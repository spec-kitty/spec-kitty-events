# Changelog

All notable changes to spec-kitty-events will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [10.0.0] - 2026-08-29

### Breaking

- `from_zeitgeist_attrs` now rejects an `occurred_at` timestamp that mixes
  ISO-8601's basic and extended spellings (for example,
  `20260825T09:00:00Z` or `2026-08-25T090000Z`). ISO-8601 requires one
  spelling across the date and time; previously Python 3.11+ could accept
  such a mixed value at this decode seam while Python 3.10 rejected it
  (EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#193).

## [9.1.5] - 2026-08-31

### Changed

- Factored the ISO-8601/RFC-3339 timestamp shape-normalization helper
  (previously byte-identical across `strict.py`, `retrospective.py`, and
  `conformance/timestamp_semantics.py`) out into a private `_iso8601`
  module. No behavior change: each module re-exports it under its existing
  local name, so consumer imports are unaffected
  (EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#143).

## [9.1.4] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- A packaged `zeitgeist_attrs` conformance fixture now rejects an inbound
  `OpsInvocationStarted` frame missing its required derived `detail_ref`
  attr, covering the decode requirement introduced with the Ops Invocation
  moment contracts (EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#192).

## [9.1.3] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed

- `to_zeitgeist_attrs` now checks a contract-versioned payload's
  `contract_version` against `KNOWN_CONTRACT_VERSIONS_BY_EVENT_TYPE` before
  encoding, using the same `UnknownContractVersionError` as decode. A
  producer on this version can no longer emit an Ops Invocation frame that
  this same version refuses to decode
  (EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#191).

## [9.1.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- Ops/Invocations bounded moment contracts: `OpsInvocationStarted` and
  `OpsInvocationCompleted` join the volatile vocabulary so operations can
  share the Team Kitty timeline with missions without reusing mission event
  kinds (EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#78). Each payload carries a stable
  `invocation_id`, `action`, a projected `actor` label, a bounded `scope`,
  an `attempt` counter for retry correlation, an explicit `contract_version`
  (default `1`), and an optional unbroadcast `request_summary` /
  `result_summary` that folds into the derived, bounded `summary` attr;
  `OpsInvocationCompleted` additionally carries a required `outcome`
  (`success`/`failure`). Both kinds derive an opaque `detail_ref` attr
  (`"<event_type>:<event_id>"`) via the new `DETAIL_REF_SOURCE_EVENT_TYPES`
  mechanism, first implementing the previously-reserved `DETAIL_REF_SYNTAX`.
  `invocation_id` + `attempt` together express start/completion/retry
  correlation and idempotency: a stable `invocation_id` ties every attempt
  of the same logical invocation together, while `attempt` disambiguates
  retries of the same invocation.
- `from_zeitgeist_attrs` now validates a decoded kind's `contract_version`
  attr against a new `KNOWN_CONTRACT_VERSIONS_BY_EVENT_TYPE` table (via the
  new, generic `CONTRACT_VERSIONED_EVENT_TYPES` opt-in mechanism) and raises
  the new `UnknownContractVersionError` on a version this package does not
  know how to interpret, rather than silently misinterpreting a future
  payload-shape revision's attrs. Currently opted in by the two Ops
  Invocation kinds only; existing kinds are unaffected.
- Nine new golden `zeitgeist_attrs` conformance fixtures cover the Ops
  Invocation kinds: minimal/with-summary/retry-attempt Started, success/
  failure-with-summary Completed, a multibyte 240-byte truncation boundary,
  an over-bound raw field, an unknown `contract_version`, and a missing
  required `outcome` key.

This is explicitly post-MVP scope only: the CLI emitter, SaaS view, and
detail-read service that would resolve a `detail_ref` are not implemented
here.

## [9.1.1] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed

- `_parse_iso8601` (`strict.py`, backing the packaged/exported
  `validate_strict_envelope`), `_assert_iso8601_timestamp` (`retrospective.py`),
  and `_extract_envelope_timestamp` (the packaged conformance helper
  `timestamp_semantics.py`) now reshape a timestamp's fractional-second
  digit count, basic/extended format, reduced time precision, and numeric
  offset before calling `datetime.fromisoformat`, so those ISO-8601
  spellings parse identically on Python 3.10 and 3.11+ instead of
  splitting by interpreter (EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#135, the mirror
  of #122's rejection-split fix at these three sibling call sites).

## [9.0.2] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed

- `strict.validate_strict_envelope`, the retrospective payload validators,
  and the conformance timestamp helper now reject a doubled trailing `Z`
  case-insensitively. A malformed mixed-case value such as
  `...00zZ` can no longer be normalized into a form that some supported
  interpreters accept (EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#124).

### Fixed

- `COMPATIBILITY.md`'s `8.0.0` migration recipe for callers outside
  `strict.STRICT_EVENT_TYPES` no longer crashes on a present-but-null (or
  otherwise non-string) `aggregate_id`. The third check used
  `record.get("aggregate_id", "").split("/", 1)[0]`, whose default only
  applies when the key is *absent* — a wire record carrying
  `aggregate_id: null` still raised `AttributeError` instead of mirroring
  `strict.py`'s own `isinstance(aggregate_id, str)` guard, which treats a
  non-string as not-forbidden rather than raising
  (EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#93, MINOR from PR #84 pass 2).
- `from_zeitgeist_attrs`'s docstring no longer claims "values are not
  reparsed here" as a blanket statement — `event_id` and `occurred_at` are
  reparsed (via `normalize_event_id` and `datetime.fromisoformat`
  respectively); the opacity claim now scopes to payload values only, with
  the two envelope-sourced exceptions stated. Also dropped the two
  unreachable-false `is not None` presence guards around that reparsing:
  `event_id`/`occurred_at` are unconditionally required for every event
  type (`ENVELOPE_ATTR_KEYS` is unioned into every kind's required keys),
  so the earlier missing-keys check always raises first when either is
  absent (EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#67, consolidating the same defect
  class as #61).
- Added a `make test-floor` target (Python 3.10, the version `pyproject.toml`'s
  `requires-python = ">=3.10"` promises) and wired it into `make test-full`, so
  version-sensitive regression guards actually run on the declared support
  floor. GitHub Actions are off programme-wide, so the `.github/workflows/`
  3.10/3.11/3.12 matrix never runs; without this, a guard that only has teeth
  on 3.10 (e.g. a trailing-Z `datetime` normalization that 3.12 accepts
  unaided) could pass on the default interpreter while being dead code on the
  floor, and a later refactor could delete it with the suite staying green
  (EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#123). This supersedes the narrower
  `make test-full-310` lane added for #141, which ran only the
  timestamp-parsing test files on 3.10 — `test-floor` runs the whole suite on
  3.10, a strict superset, so that lane and its `TIMESTAMP_PARSING_TESTS` list
  were removed as of this change to avoid running the same tests on 3.10
  twice.
- `test-floor` now runs in its own `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` (`.venv-floor`)
  instead of the default `.venv`. `uv run --python 3.10` replaces whatever
  `.venv` it is pointed at, so with `test-full: test-floor` sharing the
  default `.venv`, `test-floor` running first silently downgraded
  `test-full`'s own coverage recipe to 3.10 too — dropping default-interpreter
  coverage from `test-full` entirely, the opposite of the intended "3.10 as
  well as the default interpreter" (squad finding on PR #130).
- `from_zeitgeist_attrs` now enforces the same `event_id`/`occurred_at`
  contract the envelope itself guarantees, instead of the weaker
  emptiness/parses-at-all checks closing #28 left behind
  (EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#62). `event_id` must match one of the
  three shapes `normalize_event_id` accepts (26-char Crockford-base32 ULID,
  36-char hyphenated UUID, 32-char bare hex UUID) and is canonicalized to
  its normalized case in the returned `VolatileMoment.attrs`, so two
  spellings of the same id dedupe identically; `occurred_at` must parse as
  ISO-8601 *and* be timezone-aware, since the encoder only ever emits an
  aware `datetime`'s `isoformat()` and every downstream comparison (the
  72-hour feed window, the staleness guard) is against an aware "now".
- **Known gap, not yet closed**: `to_zeitgeist_attrs` does not yet reject a
  value carrying a non-printable character (`not str.isprintable()`) on
  encode, even though `from_zeitgeist_attrs` already rejects one on decode
  (EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#64). Until this closes, a producer whose
  `actor`/`review_ref`/id field carries a stray control character can
  broadcast successfully while a consumer's decode raises, silently
  dropping the moment. The fix — encode failing closed with the same
  `ZeitgeistAttrsControlCharacterError` decode already raises, before that
  attrs dict reaches the relay — is open as
  EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#104 and not yet merged to `main`; this
  bullet moves under a dated release heading, in past tense, once #104
  lands.

## [9.0.1] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed

- `zeitgeist_ref_for` now rejects a derived `ref` carrying control
  characters, matching the check the module's decode side
  (`from_zeitgeist_attrs`) already applies to attrs values
  (EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#106). The frame's `ref` is derived from
  the same slug/id fields (`mission_slug`, `run_id`, ...) that ride as
  attrs values, so it was the one field this module emits that a producer
  could still smuggle a control character through unchecked.

## [9.0.0] - 2026-08-28

### Breaking

- **`StatusTransitionPayload` (`WPStatusChanged`) and `MissionClosedPayload`
  (`MissionClosed`) now accept a `mission_id` key in their `zeitgeist_attrs`
  projection that every `<9.0.0` decode of these two families rejected as
  unknown.** `from_zeitgeist_attrs`'s closed key vocabulary for a kind is
  derived from its payload model's fields (`_schema_keys_for_model`); before
  this release neither model declared `mission_id`, so a `<9.0.0` consumer's
  decode of an attrs frame carrying that key raised
  `ZeitgeistAttrsError("attrs carry keys outside the ... schema")` instead of
  decoding it. This is exactly the "previously-rejected envelope now
  accepted" case `contracts/versioning-and-compatibility.md` classifies as
  major, regardless of the change being additive at the Pydantic-model
  level — the accept/reject *boundary* moved, and consumers pinned to the
  previous major fail closed on the new key the moment a producer emits it.
  `MissionCreatedPayload` is unaffected by this classification: it already
  declared `mission_id` before this release (prior, unrelated work), so its
  decode boundary already admitted the key — this bump only widens
  `StatusTransitionPayload`/`MissionClosedPayload`.
  `REF_FIELD_BY_EVENT_TYPE` itself is unchanged — `PhaseEntered` keeps
  `mission_id` as its ref and the other three keep `mission_slug` as
  theirs; only the attrs vocabulary widens
  (EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#69, resolving
  EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-planning#1012, squad MAJOR on PR #196).

### Added

- `StatusTransitionPayload` (`WPStatusChanged`) and `MissionClosedPayload`
  (`MissionClosed`) now declare an optional `mission_id` field (default
  `None`). When a producer populates it, `mission_id` rides alongside
  `mission_slug` in the `to_zeitgeist_attrs` projection for all three
  mission-scoped families, so a consumer can join one of their moments
  against a `PhaseEntered` moment (whose frame ref is `mission_id`) for the
  same mission aggregate.
- `tests/unit/test_zeitgeist_attrs.py::test_head_encode_rejected_by_previous_major_decode_boundary`
  pins the breaking boundary directly: it encodes `mission_id` onto both
  families with this release's models, then decodes the identical attrs
  against a reconstructed `<9.0.0` closed key set and asserts the decode
  raises — a durable regression guard against re-additivizing this change.

### Required consumer action

Producers (`spec-kitty`, `spec-kitty-saas`) MUST capability-gate rollout of
populating `mission_id` on `WPStatusChanged`/`MissionClosed` exactly like the
`6.0.0` `genesis`-lane precedent: do not populate the field for a broadcast
until every consumer that will read it has upgraded its
`spec-kitty-events` pin to `>=9.0.0`. A producer that populates `mission_id`
while any live consumer is still pinned `<9.0.0` causes that consumer's
`from_zeitgeist_attrs` to raise on decode, silently dropping the moment
(mirrors `contracts/lane-vocabulary.md`'s "Consumers cannot be assumed to be
typed" rollout risk). Bump the `spec-kitty-events` constraint to `>=9.0.0`
before relying on the new key; omitting `mission_id` remains fully
compatible with every prior major.

Per `PROGRAM.md` §2: bump the pinned rev/version in every consumer that adopts
`9.0.0` and name each one in that PR's Blast radius section.

## [8.2.1] - 2026-08-27

### Breaking

- **Attrs keys are rejected when any dot-separated segment is forbidden, on
  both encode and decode.** Before PR #139, `_forbidden_key_hits` checked only
  an exact key or its trailing segment, so a key such as `token.sub`,
  `url.href`, `team.name`, or `a.token.b` passed even though it contained a
  member of `FORBIDDEN_ATTR_KEYS`. Starting at implementation commit
  `d18a67a` (merged as `1e21a29`), every segment is scanned and those shapes
  raise the existing forbidden-key error instead. This security fix is a
  breaking accept/reject-boundary widening under
  `contracts/versioning-and-compatibility.md`: envelopes that previously
  encoded and decoded successfully are now rejected
  (EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#133; documentation follow-up #208).

  The package still declared `8.2.1` when this took effect. That version had
  already been declared at earlier trees, so the exact pin is the only
  unambiguous historical boundary; the later `9.0.0` bump belongs to the
  unrelated `mission_id` widening and must not be read as this fix's original
  release. Consumers moving an exact git pin across `1e21a29` must remove or
  rename attrs whose dot segments match `FORBIDDEN_ATTR_KEYS` before rollout.

### Changed

- At the original version-declaration commit, bumped the patch version only —
  no source-code change. PR #139 later changed behavior while the package
  still declared `8.2.1`; the `### Breaking` entry above records that distinct
  exact-commit boundary. `8.2.0` had been
  declared at two distinct trees on `main`: the commit three consumers had
  already adopted (`c93dbfbf`, pinned by `EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty`,
  `-saas`, and `-zeitgeist`), and a later repo-wide `ruff format` pass
  (`b67b7e0`) that also carried a real behaviour change to
  `from_zeitgeist_attrs`'s `event_id` handling — validated against the
  three `normalize_event_id` shapes and rewritten in the decoded output,
  instead of only rejected when empty and passed through verbatim. Per
  `PROGRAM.md` §2 ("a shared package's version number is spent once"),
  `8.2.0` keeps its single adopted meaning at `c93dbfbf`; every tree from
  `b67b7e0` onward is `8.2.1` (EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#170).

### Known issues

- **Not yet closed**: `to_zeitgeist_attrs` does not reject a value
  carrying a non-printable character (`not str.isprintable()`) on encode,
  even though `from_zeitgeist_attrs` already rejects one on decode
  (EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#64). Until this closes, a producer whose
  `actor`/`review_ref`/id field carries a stray control character can
  broadcast successfully while a consumer's decode raises, silently
  dropping the moment. This bullet moves to `### Fixed`, in past tense,
  once #64's encode-side check lands.

## [8.2.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Bounded moment-attribute projections for `DecisionPointOpened`,
  `DecisionPointResolved`, the `Specify`/`Plan`/`Tasks` `Started`/`Completed`
  lifecycle kinds, and a derived `summary` attr on `MissionCreated` and the
  three artifact-lifecycle `*Completed` kinds (EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#77).
  `to_zeitgeist_attrs` now builds this `summary` attr, when the kind has one,
  by joining a fixed, per-kind, deterministic sequence of source fields with
  `"; "`; it is the one attr this module allows to carry short prose, and an
  oversize `summary` is truncated (never rejected) to the 240-UTF-8-byte
  bound with a trailing `"…"` marker, always split on a whole codepoint, and
  omitted entirely rather than emitted empty when every source field is
  blank. Every other attr keeps the module's existing fail-closed,
  identifiers-only contract unchanged. `DecisionPointOpened`/
  `DecisionPointResolved` reuse the existing discriminated-union payload
  models unchanged (ADR vs. interview origin surfaces); `_schema_keys`/
  `_required_schema_keys` now compute the union/intersection of allowed and
  required keys across a kind's variants instead of assuming one payload
  model per event type. 16 new golden fixtures (14 valid, 2 invalid) cover
  max-boundary + multibyte truncation, missing optional prose, multiple
  decision options, and round-trip decode for every newly-added event type.
  `WPStatusChanged` is not given a `summary`: `StatusTransitionPayload` has
  no bounded prose source field today, and adding one is out of scope for a
  contract/projection-only change.

### Fixed

- `from_zeitgeist_attrs` now rejects an empty `event_id` and an
  `occurred_at` that does not parse as ISO-8601, instead of decoding a
  malformed envelope-sourced attr into a `VolatileMoment` a downstream
  renderer would crash on or fail to dedupe
  (EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#28).
- Keep E2 mission-run support-matrix `min_consumer_package` aligned with
  `strict_since` and the conformance fixture `min_version` floor.
- `zeitgeist_ref_for` now enforces `ZEITGEIST_ATTRS_MAX_BYTES` on the frame
  `ref` it returns, matching the module's documented bound instead of
  relying on every ref field also riding as a bounded attr value.
- `PhaseEntered`'s frame `ref` now derives from the required `mission_id`
  instead of the optional display/back-compat `mission_slug`, so a valid
  payload without that compat field no longer loses identity on the relay.
- **`zeitgeist_attrs` bounds now match zeitgeist's `EventArgs` schema**
  (spec-kitty-events#16): the relay's schema bounds attrs keys at ≤64
  *characters* and bounds values (and `ref`) at ≤240 characters **and**
  independently at ≤240 UTF-8 bytes (`maxLength` and `maxUtf8Bytes: 240`
  both present since zeitgeist commit `30d3ab4415`, closing zeitgeist#20).
  The byte bound is the one that actually binds, since byte count is
  always ≥ character count; `from_zeitgeist_attrs`'s existing UTF-8-byte
  check on values now cites that schema as its authority. The
  release-visible change is a new `ZEITGEIST_ATTR_KEY_MAX_CHARS = 64`
  bound, now enforced on keys by both `to_zeitgeist_attrs` and
  `from_zeitgeist_attrs`, which was previously unchecked (keys only went
  through the 240-byte value scan).

## [8.1.0] - 2026-08-26

Reducer unification, step 1 of 3
(EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#41; milestone "Dossier hardening", Repo
Dossier decision D): the CLI's status reducer moved into this package so the
CLI and Team Kitty's repo dossier reduce `status.events.jsonl` with one
implementation.

### Added

- **`spec_kitty_events.diary`** — the Spec Kitty status diary
  (`status.events.jsonl`) contracts and the deterministic
  diary → kanban-state reducer, moved verbatim from the CLI's
  `specify_cli/status/{models,reducer}.py` (plus the pure halves of its
  store/paths/mission-metadata helpers). Public entry points:
  `reduce(events: Iterable[dict]) -> State` (raw wire rows in, reduced
  state out), `parse_diary(rows) -> EventStream` (row partition), and
  `reduce_parsed(transitions, annotations)` (the typed fold). Also reachable
  as `spec_kitty_events.status.reduce` / `.State`.
- Conformance fixtures `status_diary/replay/*.jsonl` with pinned golden
  outputs (`*_output.json`): fresh mission, a WP through every display lane,
  out-of-order + duplicate rows, and unknown non-lane event kinds ignored.
  Loader helper: `load_reducer_output(fixture_id)`.
- Row-partition contract, unchanged from the CLI store: `kind == "annotation"`
  folds as an off-axis runtime-state annotation; an unknown `kind` fails loud
  (`DiaryError`); rows carrying an `event_type` key or a `retrospective.*`
  `event_name` are ignored in place — never fatal.

### Changed

- `Lane` in the diary module is declared `(str, Enum)` with an explicit
  `__str__` instead of `enum.StrEnum`, because this package still supports
  Python 3.10; the reducer's string snapshot slots are unchanged.
- `State` serializes to exactly the shape the CLI writes as `status.json`,
  minus the CLI-side `retrospective` attachment (computed by the CLI after
  reduction).

## [8.0.0] - 2026-08-25

E2 (EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-planning#3): the offline sync/replay story is
deleted. The CLI→SaaS sync transport it served is no longer part of the
design (see `design/ephemeral-team-status.html` in the planning repo) —
mission/WP status reaches Team Kitty through each team's own Zeitgeist
relay, not through this package's sync contracts.

### Breaking

- **Removed `spec_kitty_events.sync`** — `SYNC_*` constants,
  `SyncIngest*`/`SyncRetryScheduled`/`SyncDeadLettered`/`SyncReplayCompleted`
  and `ExternalReferenceLinked` payloads, `ReducedSyncState`,
  `reduce_sync_events`, and their JSON schemas. It had no production
  consumers.
- **Removed `spec_kitty_events.legacy`** (`legacy_envelope_v1`):
  `LegacyEnvelopeNormalizer`, `NormalizedEnvelope`,
  `UnnormalizableLegacyDiagnostic`, `RECOGNIZED_LEGACY_SHAPES`. Legacy-shape
  promotion was only ever consumed by the offline replay path.
- **Removed `spec_kitty_events.cutover`**: `CUTOVER_ARTIFACT`,
  `assert_canonical_cutover_signal`, and the rest of the artifact API.
  Consequence for consumers of `validate_event`: the envelope-level
  cutover gate (missing/wrong `schema_version`, forbidden legacy keys or
  event/aggregate names) is gone from that function's result — envelopes
  with a missing or non-canonical `schema_version="3.0.0"` signal can now
  pass `validate_event` when their payload shape validates. Fail-closed
  envelope gating still exists as the opt-in strict profile:
  `spec_kitty_events.strict.validate_strict_envelope` enforces
  `schema_version == "3.0.0"`, the recursive forbidden-key walk, and the
  full envelope key set. The forbidden legacy aggregate-name prefixes the
  gate also carried (`feature`, `feature_catalog`) are re-homed onto the
  same profile — `strict.FORBIDDEN_LEGACY_AGGREGATE_NAMES` rejects them with
  the new `FORBIDDEN_AGGREGATE_NAME` error code (issue #10) — so a strictly
  validated live path fails closed on every legacy surface again.
  `validate_event` itself stays lenient. The five conformance fixtures that
  exercised the removed gate were deleted with it; the moved boundary is
  pinned by `conformance/fixtures/cutover_boundary/`.
- Removed fixture categories: `sync`, `legacy`, and the top-level `replay`
  streams; `load_fixtures("sync")` now raises `ValueError`.
- Consumers must pin `>=8.0.0`; there are no compatibility aliases.

### Required consumer action

Bump to `spec-kitty-events==8.0.0` in `spec-kitty` and `spec-kitty-saas`.
Any code importing `spec_kitty_events.sync`, `.legacy`, or `.cutover`
must be deleted or re-homed onto the strict profile / `forbidden_keys`
modules.

E2 (spec-kitty-rearchitecture): volatile mission/WP vocabulary + zeitgeist attrs codecs.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** the support matrix moved `WPStatusChanged`, `MissionCreated`,
  `MissionClosed`, and `PhaseEntered` from `journal` to `volatile`
  durability, and added six volatile rows for the mission-run family
  (`MissionRunStarted`, `NextStepIssued`, `NextStepAutoCompleted`,
  `DecisionInputRequested`, `DecisionInputAnswered`, `MissionRunCompleted`;
  `introduced_in=2.3.0`). `SUPPORT_MATRIX` is now 30 rows (14 journal +
  16 volatile) and `support_matrix_digest()` changed accordingly —
  downstream candidates pinning the digest must re-pin.
- The strict journal profile (`STRICT_EVENT_TYPES`, now 25 types) admits the
  six mission-run types. `NextStepPlanned` stays excluded: its payload
  contract is reserved. `validate_strict_envelope` therefore accepts
  mission-run envelopes with `schema_version="3.0.0"`.
- `RuntimeActorIdentity` and the six `mission_next` payload models now
  reject unknown extra fields (`extra="forbid"`), matching every other
  strict payload family; their generated JSON schemas gained
  `additionalProperties: false`.

### Added

- `spec_kitty_events.zeitgeist_attrs`: the single owner of the mapping
  between the volatile families and zeitgeist's bounded event-frame attrs
  (`{str: str}`, ≤16 keys, ≤240 B per key/value, no forbidden keys).
  `to_zeitgeist_attrs(payload, envelope)` projects a volatile payload onto
  deterministic bounded attrs, leading with two envelope-sourced entries —
  `event_id` (Team Kitty dedupes moments on it) and `occurred_at` (the
  producer-declared occurrence time; relay receipt time carries neither).
  `from_zeitgeist_attrs()` validates inbound attrs against the kind's
  closed key vocabulary and returns a frozen `VolatileMoment`
  (`kind`, `ref`, `attrs`). Encoding never truncates: an oversize value
  raises instead, so that moment does not broadcast.
- Moments are identifiers and transition facts only. Declared unbroadcast —
  they stay in the local journal and are never part of any moment:
  structured shapes (`StatusTransitionPayload.evidence`,
  `DecisionInputRequestedPayload.options`) and free-text prose
  (`friendly_name`, `purpose_tldr`, `purpose_context`, a decision's
  `question` and `answer`, a forced transition's `reason`). Every family
  carries its actor as one canonical label string under `actor`
  (`actor_label`) — never as a field-for-field identity breakdown.
- Conformance fixtures for both codec directions under
  `conformance/fixtures/zeitgeist_attrs/` (13 valid goldens pinning exact
  attrs bytes per volatile type, 4 invalid rejections), registered in
  `manifest.json` under the new `zeitgeist_attrs` category.
- `MissionCreatedPayload` and `MissionClosedPayload` gained an optional
  plain-string `actor` (opaque identifier of who created/closed the
  mission). Optional — not required — because producers built these
  payloads without it before 8.0.0; requiring it would fail every in-flight
  emission at upgrade. It rides under the moment's `actor` key so a
  MissionCreated/Closed moment can say WHO (E2E-MVP §1.1).

### Fixed (PR #11 fix round 3)

- `RuntimeActorIdentity.actor_label` is exactly the required opaque
  `actor_id`; it no longer falls back to `display_name`. The previous
  display-name preference leaked free text onto the relay and made any
  oversize `display_name` raise at the 240-byte bound, dropping the whole
  moment. Goldens that pinned a display name now pin the actor id.
- The six mission-run payloads (`MissionRunStarted`, `NextStepIssued`,
  `NextStepAutoCompleted`, `DecisionInputRequested`,
  `DecisionInputAnswered`, `MissionRunCompleted`) gained optional
  `mission_id` / `mission_slug`. Without them, `extra="forbid"` rejected
  every mission-run event the live CLI producer emits
  (`specify_cli/sync/emitter.py` injects both keys post-hoc), breaking the
  CLI→Teamspace ingress under both strict and lenient validation; both keys
  now also ride/decode as moment identifiers.
- `conformance/test_pyargs_entrypoint.py` excludes the `zeitgeist_attrs`
  codec category from its event-fixture collection (those documents are
  `{payload, expected_attrs}` codec specifications, not envelopes) and pins
  the exclusion with a guard test: without it,
  `pytest --pyargs spec_kitty_events.conformance` failed all 13 codec
  entries while the in-repo suite stayed green.
- Known consumer follow-up: spec-kitty-saas#73 — stray `mission_key` in
  `apps/collaboration/tests/test_mission_next_conformance.py` (:24, :93,
  :113) fails `extra_forbidden` against 8.0.0; drop it when bumping this
  package there.

## [7.0.0] - 2026-08-21

F1-T1 (spec-kitty-rearchitecture, M1): strict journal profile + HarnessObservation.

### Breaking

- `MissionStartedPayload`, `MissionCompletedPayload`, `MissionCancelledPayload`,
  `PhaseEnteredPayload`, and `ReviewRollbackPayload` now reject unknown extra
  fields (`ConfigDict(extra="forbid")`; previously `frozen=True` only, so
  extras were silently ignored). No field was renamed or removed. The
  real spec-kitty producer output for `MissionStarted`/`PhaseEntered`/
  `MissionCompleted` (which already sends `mission_slug`) stays valid,
  because `mission_slug` is added to those three models (see `### Added`)
  *before* this hardening lands.
- `ValidationErrorCode` (closed enum) gains two members:
  `UNKNOWN_EVENT_TYPE`, `UNSUPPORTED_SCHEMA_VERSION`. Any code that
  exhaustively matches on `ValidationErrorCode` values must handle them.

### Added

- `spec_kitty_events.strict`: `STRICT_PROFILE_ID` (`"journal/v1"`),
  `STRICT_ENVELOPE_KEYS` (the 14 `Event` fields, all required present
  under the strict profile — nullable ones as explicit `null`),
  `STRICT_EVENT_TYPES` (19 admitted event types), `STRICT_TIMESTAMP_RULES`,
  and `validate_strict_envelope(record)` — a pure, deterministic,
  collect-all structured validator over a raw envelope dict. `Event`
  itself is unchanged and stays lenient; this is an opt-in profile for
  new producers/readers (the forthcoming F2 journal writer/reader, D1
  projector, Z1 client).
- `spec_kitty_events.harness_observation`: a new, volatile
  `HarnessObservation` event family. `ObservationKind` (closed, six
  members: `presence`, `lane_signal`, `focus_started`, `focus_heartbeat`,
  `focus_paused`, `focus_ended`), `PAYLOAD_ID_BY_KIND` (total map to
  `harness.<kind>.v1`), `HARNESS_OBSERVATION_PAYLOAD_IDS` (exactly six),
  `FORBIDDEN_OBSERVATION_KEYS` (v1), and `HarnessObservationPayload`
  (`extra="forbid"`, per-kind required/optional/forbidden field matrix).
  No time/TTL/user/team identity field exists on the payload by design —
  observations are never reduced into mission/WP state.
- `mission_slug: Optional[str] = None` added to `MissionStartedPayload`,
  `MissionCompletedPayload`, and `PhaseEnteredPayload` (display/back-compat
  field; `mission_id` remains the identity) — matches the shape the live
  spec-kitty producer (`sync/emitter.py` `emit_mission_started` /
  `emit_phase_entered` / `emit_mission_completed`) already emits.
- New JSON schema: `harness_observation_payload.schema.json`. Regenerated
  `mission_started_payload`, `mission_completed_payload`,
  `mission_cancelled_payload`, `phase_entered_payload`, and
  `review_rollback_payload` schemas (`additionalProperties: false`; three
  gain an optional `mission_slug` property).
- `spec_kitty_events.strict.SupportRow` / `SUPPORT_MATRIX` (24 rows: 18
  journal + 6 observation, exactly six payload IDs) and
  `support_matrix_digest()` — the machine-readable support matrix
  described in the F1 contract-freeze draft §3.4, generated to
  `support_matrix.json` (package data) by `schemas/generate.py` and
  covered by its `--check` drift gate. `MissionReopenedPayload` and
  `FollowUpRecordedPayload` (6.1.0) previously had no committed JSON
  schema (see the `[6.1.0]` entry below); both now do
  (`mission_reopened_payload.schema.json`,
  `follow_up_recorded_payload.schema.json`), since every support-matrix
  row must have one.
- Real fixture files for the `harness_observation` category
  (`conformance/fixtures/harness_observation/{valid,invalid}/`, 11
  fixtures) and a ninth conformance class, `envelope_strict_journal`
  (`conformance/fixtures/class_taxonomy/envelope_strict_journal/`, 7
  fixtures pinning the strict-profile-only negatives with an ordered
  `expected_error_codes` list), plus a replay golden proving
  `HarnessObservation` is never reduced into mission/WP state
  (`conformance/fixtures/harness_observation/replay/`) and a built-wheel
  content test (`tests/test_wheel_contents.py`).
- README.md's `**Package Version**` line is now pinned to
  `spec_kitty_events.__version__` by a regression test (same shape as
  the pre-existing `COMPATIBILITY.md` pin).

### Fixed

- `pyproject.toml`'s `harness_observation/{valid,invalid,replay}`
  package-data globs, added ahead of any matching file, now resolve —
  the fixtures named above exist and are verified present in a real
  built wheel by `tests/test_wheel_contents.py`.

### Known gaps carried into this release (see `COMPATIBILITY.md`)

- Replay/property-based reducer-determinism goldens R3 (timestamp
  ordering invariance) and R4 (hypothesis permutation property test) are
  not added; R1, R2, R5, R6 are covered.
  (`tests/integration/test_lifecycle_replay.py`,
  `tests/property/test_lifecycle_determinism.py`.)
- T7 (re-running the timestamp-semantics consumer-substitution fixture
  against a `HarnessObservation` envelope) is not added.
- C5's dedicated mirror test (asserting the exact symbol list
  spec-kitty's `tests/contract/spec_kitty_events_consumer/
  test_consumer_contract.py` imports) is not added; the full suite
  passing and `__init__.py`'s exports being purely additive is indirect,
  not dedicated, evidence.
- `contracts/README.md` table rows for the new module/contract are not
  updated.
- Local-appender canonicalization (the `.kittify/canonical-events.jsonl` /
  `status.events.jsonl` rows written by
  `spec-kitty/src/specify_cli/status/lifecycle_events.py`) is out of scope
  for this package; those rows fail the strict profile today and are left
  untouched (fixture-backed: `class_taxonomy/envelope_strict_journal/
  local_appender_envelope_5_0_0.json`, X10).

## [6.1.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- **Canonical contracts for two post-mission lifecycle events** (`MissionReopened`,
  `FollowUpRecorded`) — additive, wire-compatible. Added `MissionReopenedPayload`
  and `FollowUpRecordedPayload` pydantic models (`ConfigDict(frozen=True,
  extra="forbid")`), the `MISSION_REOPENED`/`FOLLOW_UP_RECORDED` type constants,
  membership in `MISSION_EVENT_TYPES`, package-root re-exports, and
  `_EVENT_TYPE_TO_MODEL` registry entries. Field shapes mirror the producer call
  sites in `spec-kitty/src/specify_cli/status/lifecycle_events.py`
  (`emit_mission_reopened` / `emit_follow_up_recorded`) and the mission
  data-model `mission-lifecycle-dispatch-drg-closeout-01KV0S99/data-model.md`.
  `MissionReopened` carries `mission_id`, `mission_slug`, `reason`, `reopened_by`,
  `reopened_at`, and optional `cleared_merge`. `FollowUpRecorded` carries
  `mission_id`, `mission_slug`, a `follow_up_type` discriminator (`"commit"`/`"pr"`),
  conditional `commit_sha`/`pr_number`, `recorded_by`, and `recorded_at`; a
  model-level validator enforces the commit-vs-pr conditional-required rule.
  Consumer: spec-kitty mission `01KV0S99` (PR Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty#1926).
  No JSON-schema entry yet (the schema layer is optional secondary).
- **`reduce_lifecycle_events` post-mission semantics** for the two new events.
  Because `MissionReopened`/`FollowUpRecorded` are members of
  `MISSION_EVENT_TYPES`, they now flow through the lifecycle reducer with
  explicit handlers placed *before* the generic post-terminal guard (which would
  otherwise misfire and flag them as `Event after terminal state` anomalies).
  A `MissionReopened` is valid only when the mission is terminal and transitions
  it to the new actionable `MissionStatus.REOPENED` state (non-terminal, so a
  fresh `MissionCompleted` is processed normally); a `FollowUpRecorded` is valid
  only when terminal and leaves `mission_status` unchanged (a recorded fact).
  Inverse contract: either event arriving before completion (mission not in a
  terminal state) is itself flagged as a `… before completion` anomaly. All
  other event semantics and existing anomaly detection are preserved.
- `MissionStatus.REOPENED = "reopened"` enum member (actionable, NOT in
  `TERMINAL_MISSION_STATUSES`).

## [6.0.0] - 2026-06-07

### Breaking

- **`genesis` added to the canonical `Lane` vocabulary** (major bump per
  `contracts/lane-vocabulary.md`: adding a canonical lane is a contract change).
  `genesis` is the non-display, pre-finalize **origin** lane: a work-package
  with no recorded lane events derives as `genesis` until `finalize-tasks` seeds
  it to `planned`. It is producer-side only — never a display/summary lane.
  Consumers that exhaustively switch over `Lane` (or pin `len(Lane) == 9`) must
  handle the new member. The on-wire envelope `schema_version` is **unchanged**
  at `3.0.0` — this widens the accepted lane value set without changing the
  wire-format shape.

### Added

- `Lane.GENESIS = "genesis"` enum member.
- `(genesis -> planned)` as a first-class allowed transition (the finalize-tasks
  seed; no `force` required). `genesis -> canceled` is allowed via the generic
  non-terminal cancel rule. All other edges into/out of `genesis` are rejected.
- `CANONICAL_TO_SYNC_V1[genesis] = planned` and
  `CANONICAL_TO_SYNC_V2[genesis] = planned` (sync mappings remain total).
- `NON_DISPLAY_LANES = {Lane.GENESIS}` and ordered `DISPLAY_LANES` so consumers
  do not infer board, summary, or UI lanes from every `Lane` member.
- Regenerated `lane.schema.json` / `status_transition_payload.schema.json` to
  include `genesis`.

### Migration

- Downstream consumers (CLI, `spec-kitty-saas`) must update their
  `spec-kitty-events` constraint to `>=6.0.0` and accept `from_lane="genesis"`
  on `WPStatusChanged`. Until they do, a genesis seed cannot fan out as a valid
  payload — producers gate on the installed package's lane capability.
- Consumers that render board columns, lane filters, summary chips, or progress
  rows must derive those surfaces from `DISPLAY_LANES`, not `Lane`, because
  `genesis` is canonical on the wire but not user-displayable.

## [5.2.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- **Canonical event-type contracts for seven previously-uncontracted SaaS-bound events** (additive, wire-compatible). Added pydantic payload models and `_EVENT_TYPE_TO_MODEL` entries for `WPAssigned`, `BuildRegistered`, `BuildHeartbeat`, `HistoryAdded`, `ErrorLogged`, `DependencyResolved`, `MissionOriginBound`. Each model uses `ConfigDict(frozen=True, extra="forbid")`. Field shapes are derived from the canonical producer call sites in `spec-kitty/src/specify_cli/sync/emitter.py` (commit `43305c12c`, lines 720–1431). Mission: `canonical-producer-contracts-legacy-envelope-01KS7JM3`. Canonical authority: `kitty-specs/canonical-producer-contracts-legacy-envelope-01KS7JM3/data-model.md`.

- **`LOCAL_ONLY_EVENT_TYPES` machine-readable classification surface** (additive). New `frozenset[str]` exported from the package root. Empty in this release — every CLI-emitted event audited as of `spec-kitty` `43305c12c` routes through `SpecKittyEventEmitter._emit()` (the SaaS-bound central path). The surface is published so downstream consumers (CLI canonical-producer lint, SaaS adapter) can import the set and adjust enforcement without re-shipping a contract.

- **`legacy_envelope_v1` named compatibility contract** (additive). New `spec_kitty_events.legacy` module exporting `LegacyEnvelopeNormalizer`, `NormalizedEnvelope`, `UnnormalizableLegacyDiagnostic`, `NormalizationResult`, `LEGACY_ENVELOPE_CONTRACT_NAME`, and `RECOGNIZED_LEGACY_SHAPES`. Three named legacy shapes are recognized in v1: `pre_3_0_envelope` (pre-3.0 envelopes missing `project_uuid`; minted via deterministic `uuid5(NAMESPACE_URL || 'spec-kitty-events/legacy', f'{node_id}/{build_id}')`), `feature_keys_envelope` (retired `feature_slug` / `feature_number` keys mapped to `mission_slug` / `mission_number`), and `awaiting_review_synonym` (payload `to_lane = "awaiting-review"` mapped to canonical `"in_review"`). Un-normalizable rows surface as structured `UnnormalizableLegacyDiagnostic` rather than silent passes. Audit-preserving: both result variants carry the original `raw` dict. Phase 3 (`spec-kitty-saas#274`) consumes this contract to replace the implicit `_should_validate_strict_envelope()` carve-out. Canonical authority: `kitty-specs/canonical-producer-contracts-legacy-envelope-01KS7JM3/contracts/legacy-envelope-v1.md`.

- **Legacy-envelope conformance fixtures**. Added `conformance/fixtures/legacy/pre_3_0_envelope_normalizes.json` (normalization-success) and `conformance/fixtures/legacy/unrecognized_legacy_diagnostic.json` (un-normalizable). Both registered in `manifest.json` under `event_type: "LegacyEnvelope"` with `fixture_type: "legacy_normalization"`.

### Changed

- **`validate_event()` enforces `validate_transition()` for `WPStatusChanged`** (semantically tighter, wire-compatible). When the pydantic shape layer accepts a `WPStatusChanged` payload, `validate_event()` now also runs the `status.validate_transition()` business-rule check. Unforced backward review-rejection transitions (the rc14→rc22 drift signature) now fail through the public conformance gate with `ModelViolation` entries that preserve the documented routing substrings `force=True` and `review-rejection`. The new behavior is gated behind a `_SEMANTIC_VALIDATORS` registry so future event types with business rules plug in additively. Mission: `canonical-producer-contracts-legacy-envelope-01KS7JM3`.

- **Pyargs conformance entrypoint extracts `.input` from wrapper fixtures**. Fixtures whose on-disk shape is `{class, expected, input, notes, [expected_error_code]}` (class_taxonomy, historical_row_raw, lane_mapping_legacy, legacy normalization) are now correctly routed: the test extracts `entry["input"]` before calling `validate_event`. Lane-mapping and legacy-envelope fixtures are excluded from the `validate_event` parametrization via `event_type` / `fixture_type` filters and exercised by dedicated tests. Diagnostic-taxonomy fixtures whose `event_type` is a sentinel (e.g. `"<missing>"`) are also excluded.

- **Stale `wp-status-changed-invalid-lane` fixture corrected**. The fixture's `to_lane` value was `"in_review"`, which has been canonical since 3.0. Replaced with `"in_reveiw"` (typo) so the Lane enum genuinely rejects it. Manifest notes updated.

- **Stale `alias_doing_normalized` fixture corrected**. The fixture used `from_lane: planned, to_lane: doing` which after alias normalization (`doing → in_progress`) produced an illegal `planned → in_progress` transition. Changed `from_lane` to `claimed` so the resulting `claimed → in_progress` transition is legal under `_ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS`. The fixture's original intent (alias normalizes to canonical) is preserved.

## [5.1.0] - 2026-05-17

### Changed

- **Executable timestamp semantics** (additive, wire-compatible). The
  `Event.timestamp` field's documentation, model docstring, and committed
  JSON Schema description now explicitly state that the value is the
  producer-assigned wall-clock occurrence time, and that consumers MUST NOT
  substitute server-receipt, import, drain, or replay time for it. The wire
  identifier (`timestamp`) is unchanged. Mission:
  `executable-event-timestamp-semantics-01KRNME2`.
  Canonical authority: `kitty-specs/teamspace-event-contract-foundation-01KQHDE4/data-model.md`
  (Timestamp Semantics: Rules R-T-01 producer wins, R-T-02 no name collision,
  R-T-03 ordering invariance).

### Added

- **Backward-transition replay conformance fixture** (additive,
  wire-compatible). Added the review-rejection cycle replay fixture under
  `conformance/fixtures/edge_cases/replay/` and included it in package data so
  consumers can exercise forced backward-transition handling directly from the
  wheel.

- `spec_kitty_events.conformance.assert_producer_occurrence_preserved` and
  `spec_kitty_events.conformance.TimestampSubstitutionError` — reusable
  consumer-side conformance helper and typed error for asserting that a
  consumer's persisted occurrence-time value equals the producer's canonical
  `timestamp`. Consumers SHOULD add a regression test calling this helper
  against the new committed fixtures in
  `src/spec_kitty_events/conformance/fixtures/timestamp_semantics/`.

### Migration Note

Consumers that previously stored server-receipt, import, drain, or replay
time under a column or field literally named `timestamp` (and used that value
as canonical event occurrence time in projections, scorecards, audit logs,
or activity feeds) must:

1. Add a separately named slot for receipt time (recommended: `received_at`).
2. Preserve the producer's `timestamp` end-to-end through ingestion and
   projection.
3. Add a regression test calling
   `assert_producer_occurrence_preserved(envelope, persisted_occurrence_time)`
   against the "old producer / recent receipt" fixture to prove the ingestion
   path does not collapse the two values.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-05-01

> **Package 5.0.0; envelope schema remains 3.0.0.** This release is a
> major **package** bump for contract behaviour changes; the on-wire
> envelope `schema_version` is unchanged at `3.0.0` (the
> cutover-contract version pinned by
> `spec_kitty_events.cutover.CUTOVER_ARTIFACT.cutover_contract_version`).
> Producers must continue to emit `schema_version="3.0.0"`.

### Breaking Changes

- **`in_review` is now a canonical lane** (FR-001, FR-002). Consumers that
  previously rejected `in_review` as an unknown lane now accept it. Update
  consumer code that switches on the lane vocabulary's exact membership.

- **Payload contracts reconciled** (FR-003, FR-004). `MissionCreatedPayload`,
  `WPStatusChangedPayload`, and `MissionClosedPayload` are now the single
  source of truth; CLI and SaaS producers must conform. See the reconciliation
  log in `kitty-specs/teamspace-event-contract-foundation-01KQHDE4/contracts/payload-reconciliation.md`.

- **Recursive forbidden-key validator** (FR-005). The package now rejects
  envelopes containing legacy keys (`feature_slug`, `feature_number`,
  `mission_key`, plus the audit-derived expansion) at any depth, including
  inside array elements. The public cutover gate
  (`assert_canonical_cutover_signal`) now routes through the recursive
  walker too — pre-bump it only checked the top level and the immediate
  payload.

### Added

- `ValidationError` and `ValidationErrorCode` for structured rejection
  reporting (NFR-006).
- `forbidden_keys` module with `FORBIDDEN_LEGACY_KEYS` and the recursive
  validator.
- Eight-class conformance fixture suite covering canonical envelopes,
  historical synthesized envelopes, every rejection class, raw historical
  rows, and lane-mapping legacy.
- `COMPATIBILITY.md` section: local-CLI compatibility vs TeamSpace ingress
  validity.

### Fixed

- `MissionClosed` payload disagreement between CLI emission and library
  model (resolved per the reconciliation log).

---

## 4.0.0 — 2026-04-23

### Breaking

- **DecisionPoint contract frozen for Decision Moment V1.** `DecisionPointOpenedPayload`, `DecisionPointDiscussingPayload`, and `DecisionPointResolvedPayload` are now Pydantic v2 discriminated unions keyed by `origin_surface` (`"adr"` or `"planning_interview"`). Existing 3.x ADR producers must add `origin_surface: "adr"` to every DecisionPoint payload.
- **`DecisionPointResolved` (interview variant) requires `terminal_outcome`** (`"resolved" | "deferred" | "canceled"`). No grace period — 4.x validators fail closed. Cross-field constraints on `final_answer`/`rationale`/`other_answer` are enforced by a Pydantic `model_validator`.

### Added

- `DecisionPointWidened` event type for Slack-backed widening of an interview-origin Decision Moment. Carries `channel`, `teamspace_ref`, `default_channel_ref`, `thread_ref`, `invited_participants`, `widened_by`, timestamps.
- `WIDENED` state in `DecisionPointState` enum. Duplicate `DecisionPointWidened` for the same `decision_point_id` is idempotent.
- Interview-origin fields on `DecisionPointOpened`: `origin_flow` (`charter`/`specify`/`plan`), `question`, `options`, `input_key`, `step_id`.
- V1 projection fields on `ReducedDecisionPointState`: `origin_surface`, `origin_flow`, `question`, `options`, `input_key`, `step_id`, `widening`, `terminal_outcome`, `final_answer`, `other_answer`, `summary`, `actual_participants`, `resolved_by`, `closed_locally_while_widened`, `closure_message`.
- Shared models: `SummaryBlock`, `TeamspaceRef`, `DefaultChannelRef`, `ThreadRef`, `ClosureMessageRef`, `WideningProjection`, `ParticipantExternalRefs`.
- `ParticipantIdentity` extended with optional `external_refs` (Slack/Teamspace IDs carried losslessly for replay).
- New reducer anomaly kind: `origin_mismatch` (events for the same `decision_point_id` with inconsistent `origin_surface`).
- Six golden replay fixtures for every V1 scenario, plus invalid conformance fixtures for schema enforcement.

### Unchanged / compatible

- `DecisionInputRequested` and `DecisionInputAnswered` payloads remain 3.x-compatible.
- ADR semantics on `DecisionPointOpenedAdrPayload`, `DecisionPointDiscussingAdrPayload`, `DecisionPointResolvedAdrPayload` are preserved exactly.
- `DecisionPointOverridden` accepts existing 3.x payloads; the optional new `origin_surface` field is additive.

### Behaviour rules

- `DecisionInputAnswered` is emitted ONLY when a real final answer is written back. Deferred and canceled terminal outcomes do NOT emit a `DecisionInputAnswered`.
- When the mission owner answers locally while a widened Slack discussion is open, `DecisionPointResolved.closed_locally_while_widened=true` is set. `closed_locally_while_widened=true` is only legal when a prior `DecisionPointWidened` exists for the same `decision_point_id`; otherwise the reducer raises an `invalid_transition` anomaly and the field is projected as `false`.

### Migration

- 3.x ADR producers: add `origin_surface: "adr"` to every DecisionPoint payload. No other field changes required.
- 3.x `DecisionInput*` producers: no changes required.
- New interview-origin producers (`spec-kitty#757`, `spec-kitty#758`): use `DecisionPointOpenedInterviewPayload`, `DecisionPointWidenedPayload`, `DecisionPointDiscussingInterviewPayload`, `DecisionPointResolvedInterviewPayload`.

### Internal

- `DECISIONPOINT_SCHEMA_VERSION` bumped from `"2.6.0"` to `"3.0.0"`.

---

## 3.3.0 — Mission Analytics Contracts (2026-04-22)

### Added

- Added canonical analytics payload contracts:
  `TokenUsageRecordedPayload` and `DiffSummaryRecordedPayload`.
- Added `TOKEN_USAGE_RECORDED`, `DIFF_SUMMARY_RECORDED`, and
  `ANALYTICS_EVENT_TYPES` exports.
- Added committed JSON schemas and conformance fixtures for the analytics
  payload family.

### Why

- `spec-kitty` and `spec-kitty-saas` now have a canonical contract surface for
  Mission Scorecard token/cost accounting and diff-summary reporting.
- Downstream consumers no longer need repo-local telemetry schemas for these
  analytics records.

## 2.9.0 — Approved Lane Contract (2026-04-04)

### Added

- Added canonical `Lane.APPROVED` to the status state model.
- Added `SyncLaneV2`, `CANONICAL_TO_SYNC_V2`, and `canonical_to_sync_v2()` for
  consumers that need an explicit `approved` board column.
- Added committed `sync_lane_v2.schema.json`.

### Changed

- `SyncLaneV1` remains locked for existing inputs, and now maps the additive
  `approved` canonical lane to legacy `done`.
- Expanded status transition validation to cover the full 8-lane workflow used
  by current Spec Kitty runtimes:
  `in_progress -> approved`, `for_review -> approved`, `approved -> done`,
  `for_review -> planned`, `approved -> in_progress`, and `approved -> planned`.
- `approved` transitions now require evidence, matching runtime emission.

### Migration

- Consumers that only need the legacy 4-lane sync model can stay on
  `canonical_to_sync_v1()`.
- Consumers that need to distinguish `approved` from `done` should move to
  `canonical_to_sync_v2()` or consume canonical `Lane` values directly.

## 2.4.0 — Mission Dossier Parity Event Contracts (2026-02-21)

### Added

**Domain events (4 new event types)**:
- `MissionDossierArtifactIndexedPayload` — emitted when an artifact is catalogued
- `MissionDossierArtifactMissingPayload` — emitted when an expected artifact is absent
- `MissionDossierSnapshotComputedPayload` — emitted when a dossier snapshot is computed
- `MissionDossierParityDriftDetectedPayload` — emitted when drift vs baseline is detected

**Provenance payload objects**:
- `LocalNamespaceTuple` — 5-field namespace key for collision-safe parity baseline scoping
- `ArtifactIdentity` — canonical artifact identity (path, class, run, wp scoping)
- `ContentHashRef` — content fingerprint (hash, algorithm, size, encoding)
- `ProvenanceRef` — source trace (event IDs, git SHA/ref, actor metadata)

**Reducer**:
- `MissionDossierState` — deterministic dossier projection output
- `reduce_mission_dossier(events)` — pure reducer: filter → sort → dedup → namespace-check → fold
- `NamespaceMixedStreamError` — raised when event stream spans multiple namespace tuples

**Conformance infrastructure**:
- 8 new JSON schemas in `src/spec_kitty_events/schemas/`
- 13 fixture cases + 2 replay streams in `conformance/fixtures/dossier/`
- `dossier` fixture category registered in `load_fixtures()`
- 5 new conformance test categories (§7.6)

### Key Invariants

- `artifact_class` is exclusively in `ArtifactIdentity` — never a top-level event payload field
- `manifest_version` is exclusively in `LocalNamespaceTuple` — never in event payloads
- Reducer sort key: `(lamport_clock, timestamp, event_id)` — three-field total order
- `NamespaceMixedStreamError` carries both expected and offending namespace tuples in the message

### Migration: spec-kitty consumers

**Version pin**: `spec-kitty-events>=2.4.0,<3.0.0`

No breaking changes. All existing exports (Event envelope, WPStatusChanged,
lifecycle, collaboration, glossary, mission-next families) are unchanged.

To emit dossier events:

```python
from spec_kitty_events import (
    MissionDossierArtifactIndexedPayload,
    LocalNamespaceTuple,
    ArtifactIdentity,
    ContentHashRef,
    MISSION_DOSSIER_ARTIFACT_INDEXED,
)
```

Always include a full `LocalNamespaceTuple` with all 5 required fields.
Use `validate_event(payload_dict, event_type)` to validate before emitting.

To reduce a dossier event stream:

```python
from spec_kitty_events import reduce_mission_dossier, NamespaceMixedStreamError

try:
    state = reduce_mission_dossier(events)
except NamespaceMixedStreamError:
    # partition stream by namespace first
    ...
```

### Migration: spec-kitty-saas consumers

**Version pin**: `spec-kitty-events>=2.4.0,<3.0.0`

No breaking changes. Import the four dossier payload models for ingestion-side validation:

```python
from spec_kitty_events import (
    MissionDossierArtifactIndexedPayload,
    MissionDossierArtifactMissingPayload,
    MissionDossierSnapshotComputedPayload,
    MissionDossierParityDriftDetectedPayload,
)
from spec_kitty_events.conformance import validate_event, load_replay_stream
```

Use fixture replay streams for integration test baselines:

```python
events = load_replay_stream("dossier-replay-happy-path")
events = load_replay_stream("dossier-replay-drift-scenario")
```

Namespace collision prevention: always include the full `LocalNamespaceTuple` when
keying parity baselines. The reducer rejects mixed-namespace streams; callers must
partition by namespace before calling `reduce_mission_dossier()`.

---

## [2.3.1] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **Canonical replay fixture stream**: `full_lifecycle.jsonl` in
  `conformance/fixtures/mission_next/replay/` -- 8-event JSONL stream covering
  the full mission-next lifecycle. Each line is a complete `Event` envelope.
  Consumers replay through projections for integration testing.
- `load_replay_stream()` in `spec_kitty_events.conformance` for programmatic
  replay fixture access.

### Fixed

- **First tagged release with mission-next contracts**: v2.3.0 was committed
  but never tagged. This release (v2.3.1) is the first tagged release shipping
  the mission-next reducer with all three correctness guards:
  - Lifecycle `MissionCompleted` alias collision rejected via payload validation
  - `run_id` consistency enforced on all post-start events
  - Malformed payloads converted to anomalies (no reducer crash)

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **Mission-next runtime contracts**: 7 event type constants (`MissionRunStarted`,
  `NextStepPlanned`, `NextStepIssued`, `NextStepAutoCompleted`,
  `DecisionInputRequested`, `DecisionInputAnswered`, `MissionRunCompleted`)
  and `MISSION_NEXT_EVENT_TYPES` frozenset.
- `RuntimeActorIdentity` value object mirroring the runtime's `ActorIdentity`
  schema (human, llm, service actor types with provider/model/tool metadata).
- 6 typed payload models for run-scoped mission execution events.
- `MissionRunStatus` enum (`RUNNING`, `COMPLETED`) with `TERMINAL_RUN_STATUSES`.
- `MissionNextAnomaly` and `ReducedMissionRunState` reducer output models.
- `reduce_mission_next_events()` — deterministic reducer for mission run state
  materialization with step tracking, decision lifecycle, and anomaly detection.
- Compatibility alias — `"MissionCompleted"` accepted as `"MissionRunCompleted"`
  for run-scoped events during migration window.
- `NextStepPlanned` reserved constant (payload contract deferred until runtime emits).
- 7 new JSON Schema files for mission-next models (44 total).
- 9 conformance payload fixtures (6 valid, 3 invalid) in `mission_next/` category.
- Hypothesis property tests for reducer determinism (200 permutations) and
  idempotent dedup (100 examples).
- 22 new exports (total package exports: 126).

## [2.2.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **UUID event ID acceptance** (backward-compatible): Envelope fields (`event_id`,
  `causation_id`, `correlation_id`) now accept ULID (26-char Crockford base32),
  hyphenated UUID (36-char), and bare hex UUID (32-char).
- `normalize_event_id()` public function for canonical ID normalization.
  Exported in `__init__.py`.
- JSON Schema patterns widened for all 3 inbound formats with strict Crockford
  base32 validation for ULIDs.
- 2 new conformance fixtures: `event-uuid-hyphenated`, `event-uuid-bare`.

### Changed

- **ULID canonicalization**: 26-char ULID IDs are now uppercased to canonical form
  and validated against Crockford base32 charset (I, L, O, U rejected).
- **UUID canonicalization**: UUID IDs lowercased to canonical hyphenated form.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added

- **Collaboration event contracts** (Feature 006):
  - 14 new event type constants and `COLLABORATION_EVENT_TYPES` frozenset
  - 3 identity/target models: `ParticipantIdentity`, `AuthPrincipalBinding`, `FocusTarget`
  - 14 typed payload models for participant lifecycle, drive intent, focus, step execution,
    advisory warnings, communication, and session linking
  - `ReducedCollaborationState` materialized view with 15 fields
  - `reduce_collaboration_events()` -- dual-mode reducer (strict/permissive) with seeded roster
    support
  - `UnknownParticipantError` for strict mode enforcement
  - `CollaborationAnomaly` for non-fatal issue recording
  - 17 new JSON Schema files for collaboration models (28 total)
  - 7 conformance payload fixtures (5 valid, 2 invalid)
  - Hypothesis property tests for reducer determinism
  - Performance benchmark (10K events in <1s)
- 36 new exports (total package exports: 104)
- SaaS-authoritative participation model documentation
- Canonical envelope mapping convention

### Changed

- **Version**: Graduated from `2.0.0rc1` to `2.1.0`.
- **Public API**: 104 exports in `__init__.py` (up from 68 in 2.0.0rc1). Added 14 event type
  constants, 3 identity/target models, 14 payload models, 3 reducer/error models, and
  `COLLABORATION_EVENT_TYPES` frozenset and `reduce_collaboration_events` function.

## [2.0.0rc1] - 2026-02-12

### Added

- **Lane Mapping Contract** (Feature 005, WP01): `SyncLaneV1` enum with 4 consumer-facing lanes
  (`planned`, `doing`, `for_review`, `done`), `CANONICAL_TO_SYNC_V1` immutable mapping, and
  `canonical_to_sync_v1()` function. Consumers import this instead of hardcoding the 7-to-4 lane
  mapping. See [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md) for the full mapping table.
- **JSON Schema Artifacts** (Feature 005, WP02): 11 JSON Schema files generated from Pydantic v2
  models, committed as canonical contract documents. Build-time generation script with CI drift
  detection (`python -m spec_kitty_events.schemas.generate --check`). Schemas available via
  `load_schema()` and `list_schemas()` from `spec_kitty_events.schemas`.
- **Conformance Validator API** (Feature 005, WP03): `validate_event()` with dual-layer validation
  (Pydantic primary + JSON Schema secondary). Returns structured `ConformanceResult` with separate
  `model_violations` and `schema_violations` buckets. Graceful degradation when `jsonschema` is not
  installed (unless `strict=True`).
- **Canonical Fixtures** (Feature 005, WP04): Manifest-driven fixture suite with `load_fixtures()`
  and `FixtureCase` dataclass for programmatic access. Categories: `events`, `lane_mapping`,
  `edge_cases`. Bundled as package data.
- **Conformance Test Suite** (Feature 005, WP05): Pytest-runnable via
  `pytest --pyargs spec_kitty_events.conformance`. Manifest-driven tests covering all event types,
  lane mappings, and edge cases. Consumer test helpers: `assert_payload_conforms()`,
  `assert_payload_fails()`, `assert_lane_mapping()`.
- **`[conformance]` Optional Extra** (Feature 005, WP06):
  `pip install spec-kitty-events[conformance]` adds `jsonschema>=4.21.0,<5.0.0` for full
  dual-layer validation.

### Changed

- **Version**: Graduated from `0.4.0-alpha` to `2.0.0rc1` (PEP 440 compliant).
- **SCHEMA_VERSION**: Updated to `"2.0.0"` (locked for the 2.x series lifetime).
- **Public API**: 68 exports in `__init__.py` (up from 65 in 0.4.0-alpha). Added `SyncLaneV1`,
  `CANONICAL_TO_SYNC_V1`, and `canonical_to_sync_v1`.

### Migration from 0.4.x

> Full migration guide in [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md).

1. **Update dependency pin**:
   ```toml
   # pyproject.toml
   dependencies = [
       "spec-kitty-events>=2.0.0rc1,<3.0.0",
   ]
   ```

2. **Replace hardcoded lane mappings** with the canonical contract:
   ```python
   # Before (consumer code):
   LANE_MAP = {"planned": "planned", "in_progress": "doing", ...}
   sync = LANE_MAP[lane_value]

   # After:
   from spec_kitty_events import Lane, SyncLaneV1, canonical_to_sync_v1
   sync_lane = canonical_to_sync_v1(Lane.IN_PROGRESS)  # SyncLaneV1.DOING
   ```

3. **Replace local status enums** with `SyncLaneV1` import:
   ```python
   # Before:
   class MyStatus(str, Enum):
       PLANNED = "planned"
       DOING = "doing"
       ...


   # After:
   from spec_kitty_events import SyncLaneV1
   # Use SyncLaneV1.PLANNED, SyncLaneV1.DOING, etc.
   ```

4. **Add conformance CI step** (recommended):
   ```bash
   pip install "spec-kitty-events[conformance]>=2.0.0rc1,<3.0.0"
   pytest --pyargs spec_kitty_events.conformance -v
   ```

5. **Event model changes**: The `Event` model now requires `correlation_id` (ULID) and includes
   `schema_version` (default `"1.0.0"`) and `data_tier` (default `0`). If you construct `Event`
   instances directly, add `correlation_id` to your constructors.

## [0.4.0-alpha] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- **Canonical Event Contract** (Feature 004): `correlation_id`, `schema_version`, `data_tier`
  fields on `Event` model. Mission lifecycle event contracts: `MissionStarted`, `MissionCompleted`,
  `MissionCancelled`, `PhaseEntered`, `ReviewRollback` with typed payload models.
- **Lifecycle Reducer**: `reduce_lifecycle_events()` with cancel-beats-re-open precedence,
  rollback-aware phase tracking, and deterministic ordering.
- **Mission Constants**: `SCHEMA_VERSION`, `MISSION_EVENT_TYPES`, `TERMINAL_MISSION_STATUSES`,
  `MissionStatus` enum.
- **Lifecycle Output Models**: `LifecycleAnomaly`, `ReducedMissionState`.

## [0.3.0-alpha] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- **Status State Model Contracts** (Feature 003): 7-lane canonical status model with `Lane` enum,
  transition validation, and deterministic reducer.
- **Enums**: `Lane` (7 lanes), `ExecutionMode` (worktree | direct_repo).
- **Evidence Models**: `RepoEvidence`, `VerificationEntry`, `ReviewVerdict`, `DoneEvidence`.
- **Transition Models**: `ForceMetadata`, `StatusTransitionPayload` (immutable, cross-field
  validated), `TransitionValidationResult`, `TransitionError`.
- **Reducer**: `reduce_status_events()` with rollback-aware precedence, `WPState`,
  `TransitionAnomaly`, `ReducedStatus`.
- **Utilities**: `normalize_lane()` (alias handling), `validate_transition()`,
  `status_event_sort_key()`, `dedup_events()`.
- **Constants**: `TERMINAL_LANES`, `LANE_ALIASES`, `WP_STATUS_CHANGED`.

## [0.2.0-alpha] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- **GitHub Gate Observability Contracts** (Feature 002): `GatePayloadBase`, `GatePassedPayload`,
  `GateFailedPayload` models. `map_check_run_conclusion()` for deterministic mapping from GitHub
  `check_run` conclusion strings to event types. `UnknownConclusionError` exception.
- Ignored conclusions (`neutral`, `skipped`, `stale`) logged with optional callback.

## [0.1.1-alpha] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- `project_uuid` field on `Event` model (required, `uuid.UUID`).
- `project_slug` field on `Event` model (optional, `str`, default `None`).

### Breaking Changes

- All `Event()` constructors must now include `project_uuid` parameter.

## [0.1.0-alpha] - 2026-01-27

### Added

- **Core Event Model**: Immutable `Event` with causal metadata (Pydantic frozen). ULID event IDs,
  Lamport clocks, causation chains.
- **Lamport Clocks**: `LamportClock` with `tick()`, `update()`, `current()`.
- **Conflict Detection**: `is_concurrent()`, `total_order_key()`, `topological_sort()`.
- **CRDT Merge Functions**: `merge_gset()` (grow-only sets), `merge_counter()` (with dedup).
- **State-Machine Merge**: `state_machine_merge()` with priority-based winner selection.
- **Error Logging**: `ErrorLog` with append-only semantics and retention policy.
- **Storage Adapters**: Abstract base classes (`EventStore`, `ClockStorage`, `ErrorStorage`) and
  in-memory implementations.
- **Type Safety**: Full `mypy --strict` compliance, `py.typed` marker (PEP 561).
