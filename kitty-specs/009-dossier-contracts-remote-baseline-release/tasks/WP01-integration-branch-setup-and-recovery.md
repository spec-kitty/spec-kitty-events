# Work Package Prompt: WP01 – Integration Branch Setup & Recovery

## Context

Feature 009 recovers the Feature 008 dossier contracts implementation from git
reflog and integrates it onto a new branch from `origin/2.x`. This is a
strict serial pipeline: WP01 → WP02 → WP03.

**Strategy**: Path A — recover Feature 008 implementation from git reflog,
integrate onto `009-dossier-release` branch from `origin/2.x`, pass all local
quality gates, merge via PR, cut `v2.4.0` tag from the `2.x` merge commit.

**Path B fallback**: If cherry-pick conflicts or test failures cannot be
resolved cleanly, abandon Path A. Open a new plan for re-implementation from
the Feature 008 spec (recoverable from reflog artifacts). Path B trigger
conditions are documented in `plan.md`.

## Goal

Create `009-dossier-release` branch from `origin/2.x` HEAD and apply the
two Feature 008 commits cleanly via cherry-pick.

**Independent Test**: `git log --oneline 009-dossier-release` shows both
`5237894` (feat(008)) and `139ca09` (fix(dossier)) cherry-picked on top of
`640709f`, with no conflicts.

## Subtasks

- [ ] T001 Verify reflog accessibility for both recovery commits
- [ ] T002 Create `009-dossier-release` branch from `origin/2.x`
- [ ] T003 Cherry-pick `5237894` (feat(008) merge commit)
- [ ] T004 Cherry-pick `139ca09` (namespace mismatch fix)
- [ ] T005 Confirm `640709f` is an ancestor of the branch
- [ ] T006 Verify recovered file inventory matches expected 41-file set

## Implementation Notes

- Work directly in the main repo root (not a worktree)
- `640709f` is already in `origin/2.x` HEAD, so starting from `origin/2.x`
  automatically includes it
- Cherry-pick `5237894` first (it's the larger merge commit); `139ca09`
  touches only `dossier.py` and `test_dossier_reducer.py`
- If `5237894` cherry-pick produces conflicts: stop, document the conflict,
  trigger Path B

## Parallel Opportunities

None — all steps are serial; each depends on the previous.

## Dependencies

None (starting package).

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Reflog expiry**: If commits are not accessible, Path B is mandatory. Check
  immediately at T001.
- **Cherry-pick conflicts**: `640709f` is docs-only, so conflicts are unlikely;
  if they occur, investigate before forcing.
