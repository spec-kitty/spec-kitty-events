## ⚡ Do This First: Load Agent Profile

```
/ad-hoc-profile-load implementer-ivan
```

---

## Objective

Land the final mission-close gate: a per-envelope validation performance benchmark proving NFR-005's < 5 ms p95 budget, and a `review-handoff.md` document that maps every spec SC-### to its evidence so Codex can review efficiently.

---

## Context

- Spec: NFR-005, C-005, SC-007.
- Plan: Test Strategy section names this benchmark explicitly.
- Mission close gate: Codex review per C-005.

---

## Subtasks

### T028 — Author `tests/test_validation_benchmark.py`

**Purpose**: Prove NFR-005's < 5 ms p95 envelope validation budget.

**Steps**:
1. Create `tests/test_validation_benchmark.py`.
2. Build a representative fixture sample by reading the conformance fixture suite (e.g., 50 fixtures across classes, biased toward `envelope_valid_canonical` and `envelope_valid_historical_synthesized`).
3. Time validation per fixture using a high-resolution clock; collect 100 samples per fixture.
4. Compute the 95th percentile across all samples.
5. Assert p95 < 5 ms.

   ```python
   import time
   import pytest
   from spec_kitty_events.conformance import load_manifest_entries, load_fixture
   from spec_kitty_events import validate_envelope  # adjust to actual public API


   def measure_one(envelope, iterations=100):
       times = []
       for _ in range(iterations):
           t0 = time.perf_counter_ns()
           validate_envelope(envelope)
           t1 = time.perf_counter_ns()
           times.append(t1 - t0)
       return times


   def percentile(values, p):
       values_sorted = sorted(values)
       k = int(round((p / 100.0) * (len(values_sorted) - 1)))
       return values_sorted[k]


   def test_validation_p95_under_5ms():
       all_times_ns = []
       sample_classes = ["envelope_valid_canonical", "envelope_valid_historical_synthesized"]
       for entry in load_manifest_entries():
           if entry["class"] not in sample_classes:
               continue
           fixture = load_fixture(entry["path"])
           all_times_ns.extend(measure_one(fixture["input"]))
       assert all_times_ns, "no fixtures sampled"
       p95_ns = percentile(all_times_ns, 95)
       p95_ms = p95_ns / 1_000_000
       assert p95_ms < 5.0, f"p95 envelope validation = {p95_ms:.3f}ms (>= 5.0)"
   ```

6. Mark the test with `@pytest.mark.benchmark` (or similar) so it can be run separately if needed.

7. If the benchmark is flaky on heavily-loaded CI, set the threshold with a small buffer (e.g., 5.0 ms) and document the choice; keep the test in the standard pytest run unless a CI signal proves it must be moved.

**Files**:
- `tests/test_validation_benchmark.py` (new, ~80–120 lines)

**Validation**:
- [ ] Test passes locally with comfortable margin.
- [ ] Test fails (deliberately) when seeded with a 50 ms sleep inside the validator (manually verify, then revert).

---

### T029 — Run full pytest + mypy --strict + schema-drift; document results

**Purpose**: Final all-green check before review.

**Steps**:
1. Run the full local test pipeline:
   ```
   pytest -q
   mypy --strict src/spec_kitty_events
   python -m spec_kitty_events.schemas.generate  # confirm zero diff
   ```
2. Capture the output of each command.
3. Append a "Verification Results" subsection to the review-handoff doc (see T030) with the captured outputs (or summaries).
4. If any command fails, **stop** and surface the failure to the orchestrator. Do not proceed to T030.

**Files**:
- (no file edits; results inform T030)

**Validation**:
- [ ] All three commands return success exit codes.
- [ ] Schema regeneration produces zero diff against committed schemas.

---

### T030 — Author `kitty-specs/.../contracts/.review-handoff.md`

**Purpose**: A single document Codex can read to verify mission completeness, with each SC-### mapped to its evidence.

**Steps**:
1. Create `kitty-specs/teamspace-event-contract-foundation-01KQHDE4/contracts/.review-handoff.md`.
2. Structure:

   ```markdown
   # Codex Review Handoff: TeamSpace Event Contract Foundation

   **Mission**: `teamspace-event-contract-foundation-01KQHDE4`
   **Reviewer**: Codex (mandatory per C-005)
   **Branch**: main → main
   **Date**: 2026-05-01

3. Fill in every cell with concrete file paths and test names. Do not leave generic prose.

**Files**:
- `kitty-specs/teamspace-event-contract-foundation-01KQHDE4/contracts/.review-handoff.md` (new)

**Validation**:
- [ ] Every spec ID has an evidence cell with a real file path or test name.
- [ ] No "TBD" or "..." placeholders remain.

---

## Branch Strategy

- Planning/base branch: `main` · Merge target: `main` · Worktree allocated by `finalize-tasks`.

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] `tests/test_validation_benchmark.py` passes (p95 < 5 ms).
- [ ] T029 verification: pytest green, mypy --strict green, schema regen zero diff.
- [ ] `review-handoff.md` exists with full spec-to-evidence mapping.
- [ ] No file outside `owned_files` modified.

---

## Risks

- **R-1**: Benchmark flakiness on shared CI. Mitigation: p95 (not p100), generous threshold buffer, mark with a tag if needed for retry policy.
- **R-2**: A late discovery that a previous WP's validation is missing. Mitigation: T029 catches it via mypy/pytest; surface to orchestrator before T030.

---

## Reviewer Guidance

Codex reviewer will read this WP's review-handoff doc as the entry point to the mission. Specifically:

1. Verify that every SC-### maps to a real test or artifact.
2. Spot-check a few mappings (e.g., open the `historical_row_raw` fixtures and confirm they are rejected by manual reading).
3. Inspect the reconciliation log in `contracts/payload-reconciliation.md` for completeness.
4. Confirm the Breaking Changes language in CHANGELOG matches reality.
5. Sign off in the "Reviewer notes" section of the handoff doc to close C-005 and SC-007.
