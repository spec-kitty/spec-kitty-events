# Specification Quality Checklist: Mission Contract Cutover

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Requirement types are separated (Functional / Non-Functional / Constraints)
- [x] IDs are unique across FR-###, NFR-###, and C-### entries
- [x] All requirement rows include a non-empty Status value
- [x] Non-functional requirements include measurable thresholds
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass after initial validation.
- Implementation scope is explicitly limited to `spec-kitty-events`; downstream rejection behavior and lockstep rollout are documented as external release gates.
- Mixed old/new client operation is explicitly unsupported and treated as a release blocker.
- The spec now defines a machine-checkable cutover contract-version gate plus a forbidden legacy surface set for deterministic downstream rejection.
- `kitty-specs/*/meta.json` is explicitly treated as workflow metadata, not a released event-contract surface, for this mission.
