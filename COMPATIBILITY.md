# Compatibility Guide

**Current package version**: `10.0.0`

The on-wire envelope schema version is `3.0.0` and has been unchanged since
the cutover. The package version and the envelope schema version move
independently — see
[`contracts/versioning-and-compatibility.md`](contracts/versioning-and-compatibility.md).

`spec-kitty-events` is a fail-closed contract package. Released sections
below are ordered newest-first by the release that introduced them. An
unreleased `## Known gap (not yet closed)` section documents a gap no
release has closed yet; it carries no version number and precedes every
released section, regardless of when the gap it describes will close.

> The single declaration above is the only place this document states the
> package version; `tests/test_compatibility_doc.py` pins it to
> `spec_kitty_events.__version__`. Do not restate it in prose.

This document is the public compatibility policy for consumers of:

- `spec-kitty-events`
- `spec-kitty-saas`
- `spec-kitty`

## Known gap (not yet closed) — `to_zeitgeist_attrs` does not yet reject control characters on encode

`from_zeitgeist_attrs` rejects an attrs value carrying a non-printable
character on decode (`str.isprintable()`, EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#25,
then widened by #63), but `to_zeitgeist_attrs` does not yet run the same
check on encode (EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#64): a producer can
successfully encode and broadcast an attrs value carrying a control
character that a consumer's decode will then reject, silently dropping the
moment. The fix — both directions sharing one predicate and raising the
same typed `ZeitgeistAttrsControlCharacterError` — is open as
EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#104 and not yet merged to `main`. This
section is written ahead of that merge so the documentation gap doesn't
reopen once it lands; it becomes a normal dated-version entry, and this
"known gap" framing goes away, when #104 merges.

## `10.0.0` — mixed ISO-8601 `occurred_at` spellings rejected (breaking)

`from_zeitgeist_attrs` now rejects an `occurred_at` value that combines
ISO-8601's basic date with its extended time, or its extended date with its
basic time (for example, `20260825T09:00:00Z` or `2026-08-25T090000Z`).
ISO-8601 requires one spelling across the date and time. The check is a
positive calendar-date shape match, so it also rejects reduced-precision
mixed spellings, arbitrary single-character separators that Python 3.11+
`fromisoformat` accepts, and week-date mixes.

The accepted spellings are:

- extended: `YYYY-MM-DD[T ]HH:MM[:SS]`
- basic: `YYYYMMDD[T ]HH[MM[SS]]`

Both spellings may carry a decimal fraction and `Z`, `±HH:MM`, or `±HHMM`.
Decode reshapes only its private parsing candidate, so accepted wire bytes —
including a valid basic timestamp — remain unchanged in the returned attrs.
Python 3.11+ previously accepted the malformed examples above while Python
3.10 rejected them; Python 3.10 also rejected valid basic timestamps. This
release makes both outcomes consistent across supported Python versions.

This is a consumer-visible narrowing and widening of the attrs decode
boundary, so it is a major package bump. Producers that emit
`datetime.isoformat()` or otherwise keep one spelling across the date and
time are unaffected. Producers carrying mixed spellings must emit one of the
forms above consistently.
No envelope schema, event type, payload model, or attrs key changes in this
release.

## `9.1.5` — decoded detail refs follow canonical event IDs

`9.1.5` fixes a follow-up to the `9.1.2` decode guard. A wire frame whose
`event_id` and derived `detail_ref` use the same noncanonical spelling was
accepted, but the decoded `VolatileMoment` kept the canonicalized
`event_id` beside the raw `detail_ref`. Decode now rewrites that derived
`detail_ref` to the canonical `event_id` spelling as well, keeping the
decoded attrs self-consistent. Canonical frames are unaffected.

## `9.1.4` — missing Ops Invocation `detail_ref` rejection is pinned

`9.1.4` adds a packaged conformance fixture for an inbound
`OpsInvocationStarted` frame that omits the required derived `detail_ref`
attr. Decode already rejected that frame, so no runtime behavior changes;
the fixture prevents a future refactor from silently dropping the
requirement.

## `9.1.3` — encode rejects unknown Ops Invocation contract versions

`9.1.3` tightens `to_zeitgeist_attrs` for every contract-versioned event
type. Before encoding, it checks the payload's `contract_version` against
the same `KNOWN_CONTRACT_VERSIONS_BY_EVENT_TYPE` table used by
`from_zeitgeist_attrs`. A producer that mis-stamps version `1` payloads with
an unknown version now fails locally with `UnknownContractVersionError`
rather than emitting a frame this same package version discards on decode.
Known-version frames are unaffected.

## `9.1.2` — derived `detail_ref` attrs must resolve to their own moment

`9.1.2` tightens `from_zeitgeist_attrs` for the Ops Invocation event types.
Their `detail_ref` attr is mechanically derived as
`"<event_type>:<event_id>"`, so decode now rejects a wire frame whose
`detail_ref` points at another event or uses an unrelated value. Frames
produced by this package are unaffected; only malformed inbound frames that
previously decoded are rejected.

## `9.1.1` — timestamp parsing normalized across supported Python versions

`9.1.1` is a parser bug fix, not a new event family or payload field. The
strict envelope validator, retrospective timestamp validation, and packaged
timestamp conformance helper now normalize supported ISO-8601 spellings
before calling `datetime.fromisoformat`, so Python 3.10 accepts the same
fractional-second precision, basic format, reduced precision, and numeric
offset spellings that Python 3.11+ already accepted. No producer or consumer
migration is required.

## `9.0.2` — mixed-case doubled `Z` UTC designators are rejected

`9.0.2` tightens timestamp validation at three normalization sites:
`strict.validate_strict_envelope`, the retrospective payload validators, and
the packaged conformance timestamp helper. A malformed value ending in `zZ`
is now rejected instead of being normalized to a lowercase-`z` form that some
supported Python interpreters accept. Producers already sending one valid UTC
designator are unaffected.

## `9.0.1` — `zeitgeist_ref_for` rejects control characters in the derived ref

`9.0.1` tightens the producer-side reject boundary for volatile moments.
`zeitgeist_ref_for` now applies the same `str.isprintable()` check as attrs
values to its derived `ref`, so a control or formatting character in a ref
source such as `mission_slug`, `mission_id`, `run_id`, or
`decision_point_id` raises `ZeitgeistAttrsControlCharacterError` instead of
reaching the relay. Producers with printable refs are unaffected; producers
that previously relied on non-printable ref values must clean or reject those
values before calling the codec.

## `9.0.0` — `mission_id` widened onto `WPStatusChanged`/`MissionCreated`/`MissionClosed` for cross-family join (breaking)

`9.0.0` is a **breaking accept/decode-boundary change**, not additive,
despite the Pydantic-model diff itself being a new optional field.
`PhaseEnteredPayload` has always used `mission_id` (required) as its
`REF_FIELD_BY_EVENT_TYPE` frame ref, while the other three mission-scoped
volatile families — `WPStatusChangedPayload` (`StatusTransitionPayload`),
`MissionCreatedPayload`, and `MissionClosedPayload` — use `mission_slug` as
their ref. Until this release, `StatusTransitionPayload` and
`MissionClosedPayload` did not declare `mission_id` at all, so
`from_zeitgeist_attrs`'s closed, schema-derived key vocabulary
(`_schema_keys_for_model`) never admitted it for either family: an attrs
frame carrying `mission_id` for a `WPStatusChanged` or `MissionClosed`
moment raised `ZeitgeistAttrsError` on decode. A consumer therefore had no
shared key to join one of their moments against a `PhaseEntered` moment for
the same mission aggregate — and, symmetrically, no way to receive one
without it being rejected.

This release adds an optional `mission_id` field (default `None`) to
`StatusTransitionPayload` and `MissionClosedPayload`; when a producer
populates it, `mission_id` rides alongside `mission_slug` in the encoded
`to_zeitgeist_attrs` projection for all three families. Per
[`EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-planning`#1012](https://github.com/spec-kitty/EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-planning/issues/1012),
this is Option 2: `REF_FIELD_BY_EVENT_TYPE` itself is unchanged —
`PhaseEntered`'s ref stays `mission_id` and the other three keep
`mission_slug` as their ref — only the attrs widen.

**Why this is major, not minor.** Per
[`contracts/versioning-and-compatibility.md`](contracts/versioning-and-compatibility.md),
"any change to an existing event contract that makes a previously-rejected
envelope accepted" is major. A producer that starts populating `mission_id`
on `WPStatusChanged`/`MissionClosed` moves those two families' encoded
attrs from a shape every `<9.0.0` decode rejected to one every `>=9.0.0`
decode accepts — the accept/reject boundary moved, which is exactly the
"new capability that widens an existing family's contract" case the
`6.1.0` new-event-type precedent does *not* cover (a whole new event type
is additive because no existing contract's boundary moves; this is the
opposite: an existing family's own boundary moves). `MissionCreatedPayload`
is excluded from this classification — it already declared `mission_id`
before this release (prior, unrelated work), so its decode boundary
already admitted the key and this bump changes nothing about its
compatibility story.

**Producers that omit `mission_id` are unaffected**: the field stays
optional and is omitted from attrs when absent, so a producer that never
populates it is wire-compatible with every `<9.0.0` consumer, exactly as
before. The breaking surface is scoped entirely to producers that *do*
populate the field.

**Required migration.**

- Consumers (`spec-kitty-saas`, `spec-kitty`, any other reader of
  `WPStatusChanged`/`MissionClosed` zeitgeist attrs) must bump their
  `spec-kitty-events` pin to `>=9.0.0` before a producer in their path
  starts populating `mission_id` on these two families.
- Producers MUST capability-gate the rollout exactly like the `6.0.0`
  `genesis`-lane precedent (see
  [`contracts/lane-vocabulary.md`](contracts/lane-vocabulary.md)'s
  "Versioning" section): do not populate `mission_id` on
  `WPStatusChanged`/`MissionClosed` for a given broadcast until every
  consumer that will read it is known to be on `>=9.0.0`. Populating it
  while any live consumer is still pinned `<9.0.0` causes that consumer's
  `from_zeitgeist_attrs` call to raise on decode, silently dropping the
  moment.
- `EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#69` closes with this artifact set;
  `EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#197`/`#198` track the two MINOR
  documentation/conformance-coverage follow-ups the squad also filed
  against the originating PR.

## `8.2.1` — forbidden attrs rejected in every dot segment (breaking boundary shipped without a major bump)

PR
[`EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#139`](https://github.com/spec-kitty/EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events/pull/139)
widened `_forbidden_key_hits` on both `to_zeitgeist_attrs` encode and
`from_zeitgeist_attrs` decode. The old predicate rejected an exact forbidden
key and a forbidden trailing segment, but missed the same name in a prefix or
middle segment. Consequently `token.sub`, `url.href`, `team.name`, and
`a.token.b` previously passed; starting at implementation commit `d18a67a`
(merge commit `1e21a29`) each is rejected because at least one dot-separated
segment belongs to `FORBIDDEN_ATTR_KEYS`.

This is a **breaking reject-boundary widening**, not an additive validation
improvement. `contracts/versioning-and-compatibility.md` explicitly classifies
"adding to the forbidden-key set, or widening where it is enforced" as major:
a producer or consumer can move from accepting an identical attrs frame to
raising the existing forbidden-key error solely by updating this package.
The behavior is intentional and security-motivated; forbidden names include
`token`, `authorization`, `bearer`, `password`, `url`, and team/deployment
identifiers that must not leak into broadcast attrs.

**Historical version boundary.** The package declared `8.2.1` at `1e21a29`.
That version number had already been used at earlier trees, so `8.2.1` alone
cannot identify whether this rule is present: exact git pins before `1e21a29`
lack it, while pins at or after that merge contain it. The later `9.0.0`
release records a separate `mission_id` accept-boundary widening; it does not
retroactively make PR #139 a correctly-versioned 9.0.0 change. This section
documents the shipped boundary rather than rewriting package history.

**Required migration.** Before moving a consumer or producer pin across
`1e21a29`, inspect every emitted and stored zeitgeist attrs key. Rename or
remove a key when any dot-separated segment matches `FORBIDDEN_ATTR_KEYS`;
do not bypass or weaken the guard. Consumers already pinned to current
`9.0.0` have this rejection behavior.

## `8.0.0` — Sync, legacy-envelope, and cutover surfaces deleted

`8.0.0` deletes three modules whose only consumer was the offline
CLI→SaaS sync/replay story that the programme retired:

- `spec_kitty_events.sync` (Sync lifecycle contracts + reducer) — had no
  production consumers.
- `spec_kitty_events.legacy` (`legacy_envelope_v1` normalizer).
- `spec_kitty_events.cutover` (`CUTOVER_ARTIFACT` and helpers).

Consumer-visible consequence beyond the missing imports: `validate_event()`
no longer applies the envelope-level cutover gate. An envelope with a
missing or non-canonical `schema_version`, or one carrying forbidden legacy
keys/names at envelope level, can now pass `validate_event` when its payload
shape validates. Fail-closed envelope validation still exists as the opt-in
strict profile — `validate_strict_envelope()` enforces
`schema_version == "3.0.0"`, the recursive forbidden-key walk
(`forbidden_keys.find_forbidden_keys`), the full envelope key set, and the
forbidden legacy aggregate-name prefixes (`strict.FORBIDDEN_LEGACY_AGGREGATE_NAMES`,
re-homed from the deleted artifact per issue #10).
Producers and ingress paths that relied on `validate_event` for the gate
must switch to the strict profile.

That switch is a single call only for the event types
`spec_kitty_events.strict.STRICT_EVENT_TYPES` admits (the fixed
lifecycle/WP/project/harness allowlist) — `validate_strict_envelope()`
rejects every other event type with `UNKNOWN_EVENT_TYPE` regardless of
whether the envelope is otherwise well-formed. Callers whose event type is
outside that allowlist must reproduce the removed gate's checks directly
instead: `forbidden_keys.validate_no_forbidden_keys(record,
forbidden=FORBIDDEN_LEGACY_KEYS) is None` for the recursive legacy-key walk
(callers needing every error rather than just the first can use
`list(forbidden_keys.find_forbidden_keys(record,
forbidden=FORBIDDEN_LEGACY_KEYS))` instead), an
explicit `record.get("schema_version") == "3.0.0"` check for the envelope
signal, `(not isinstance(aggregate_id := record.get("aggregate_id"), str)) or
aggregate_id.split("/", 1)[0] not in strict.FORBIDDEN_LEGACY_AGGREGATE_NAMES`
for the forbidden legacy aggregate-name prefix, and
`record.get("event_type") not in {"FeatureCreated",
"FeatureClosed"}` for the forbidden legacy event names (see `## Forbidden
Legacy Surfaces` below for that list's source). The `isinstance` guard on
the aggregate-name check matters: a wire record can carry `aggregate_id:
null` or another non-string, and `strict.py`'s own gate
(`isinstance(aggregate_id, str)`) treats that as not-forbidden rather than
raising, so a recipe that instead does `record.get("aggregate_id",
"").split(...)` raises `AttributeError` on exactly that input instead of
reproducing the gate. Unlike the other three checks, no package constant
survives for the legacy event names — they were deleted outright in
`8.0.0` and not re-homed — so this document is the only place a caller
outside the strict profile can find them.

Migration: pin `>=8.0.0`; delete or re-home any import of the three
modules. There are no aliases. See `CHANGELOG.md` (`### Breaking`) for the
full removed-name list.

## `7.0.0` — Strict journal profile + HarnessObservation

`7.0.0` publishes `spec_kitty_events.strict.validate_strict_envelope`: an
opt-in, deterministic, structured validator over the existing envelope and
lifecycle/WP contracts (`Event` itself is unchanged and stays lenient — see
`### Breaking` below for what *is* newly rejected by the strict profile).
It also publishes `spec_kitty_events.harness_observation`: a new, volatile
`HarnessObservation` event family with exactly six payload IDs
(`harness.presence.v1`, `harness.lane_signal.v1`, `harness.focus_started.v1`,
`harness.focus_heartbeat.v1`, `harness.focus_paused.v1`,
`harness.focus_ended.v1`). Observations are never reduced into mission/WP
state and carry no time/TTL/user/team field.

The machine-readable **support matrix** —
`spec_kitty_events.strict.SUPPORT_MATRIX` / the published
`support_matrix.json` package-data copy, generated by `schemas/generate.py`
and drift-checked alongside every other schema — is the authority for
"which payload IDs / event types this package supports": 14 journal rows,
16 volatile rows (the Ephemeral Team Status vocabulary — `WPStatusChanged`,
`MissionCreated`, `MissionClosed`, `PhaseEntered`, the six `mission_next`
mission-run types — plus 6 observation rows, one per `ObservationKind`,
each with its payload ID). See the `[8.0.0]` CHANGELOG section for the
E2 durability promotion and the `zeitgeist_attrs` codecs.
`spec_kitty_events.strict.support_matrix_digest()` is what downstream
candidates pin in `declared_dependency_contracts` (see
`tests/test_support_matrix.py` for the pinned row/payload-ID counts; the
row contents are not restated here per the anti-restatement rule below).

Skew story (6.x ↔ 7.0):

- a 6.x consumer calling `validate_event(payload, "HarnessObservation")`
  raises `ValueError("Unknown event type: ...")` — fail closed, unchanged
  API shape;
- a 6.x consumer given a 7.0 `MissionStarted` payload that carries the new
  optional `mission_slug` field still accepts it (the 6.x model is lenient)
  — benign forward-compat;
- a 7.0 consumer rejects a `MissionStarted` payload carrying an unknown
  extra field with `PAYLOAD_SCHEMA_FAIL` (new in `7.0.0`; the four-field
  shape with no `mission_slug` remains valid, since the field is optional).

Local-appender canonicalization debt (out of scope for this release):
every envelope written today by
`spec-kitty/src/specify_cli/status/lifecycle_events.py`'s `_build_envelope`
(`.kittify/canonical-events.jsonl`, `status.events.jsonl`) fails the strict
profile on multiple counts (`schema_version="5.0.0"`, an extra
`aggregate_type` key, several missing envelope keys) and its
`ReviewerSelfApproval` rows additionally have no events model. This
package does not rewrite those rows; local-CLI permissive reading of them
is unweakened. Canonicalizing the appender is out of scope for this
release (tracked for the journal-writer work that consumes this contract).

## Canonical On-Wire Policy

Note: the **envelope schema on the wire** is at version `3.0.0`, which is not
the package version declared at the top of this document. The two are
intentionally distinct (see the bump-rationale section below).

- Signal field: `schema_version`
- Signal location: event envelope
- Required value: `3.0.0`

Since `8.0.0` removed the cutover artifact, this gate is enforced by the
strict profile (`validate_strict_envelope`) and by the recursive
forbidden-key walker (`spec_kitty_events.forbidden_keys`), not by
`validate_event`. Live ingestion paths fail closed when any of the
following are true:

- the envelope is missing `schema_version`
- `schema_version` does not equal `3.0.0`
- the envelope or nested payload contains forbidden legacy keys (recursive walk)
- `aggregate_id` uses a forbidden legacy aggregate name (`feature`,
  `feature_catalog`) — rejected with `FORBIDDEN_AGGREGATE_NAME`

## Forbidden Legacy Surfaces

Legacy mission-domain surfaces rejected on live paths (as of `8.0.0`, by
the strict profile / forbidden-key walker rather than `validate_event`):

- keys: `feature_slug`, `feature_number`, `mission_key`, `legacy_aggregate_id`
  — rejected at any depth by `forbidden_keys.find_forbidden_keys`.
- event names: `FeatureCreated`, `FeatureClosed` — not members of
  `STRICT_EVENT_TYPES`, so the strict profile rejects them.
- aggregate name prefixes: `feature`, `feature_catalog` — the dedicated
  prefix check shipped with the cutover artifact and left `validate_event`
  with it in `8.0.0`; it was deliberately **re-homed onto the strict
  profile** (`strict.FORBIDDEN_LEGACY_AGGREGATE_NAMES`, error code
  `FORBIDDEN_AGGREGATE_NAME`) rather than dropped, so a live path that
  validates strictly still fails closed on `aggregate_id="feature/WP01"`
  (issue #10). `validate_event` stays lenient; offline rewrite jobs should
  still convert such ids.

## Canonical Mission And Build Taxonomy

Public mission-domain payloads use:

- `mission_slug`: canonical mission instance identifier
- `mission_number`: canonical numeric mission identifier
- `mission_type`: canonical workflow/template identifier

Event envelopes distinguish build and node identity explicitly:

- `build_id`: emitting build identifier
- `node_id`: emitting node identifier within that build

## Rollout Policy

There are no runtime compatibility bridges in live ingestion.

- New producers must emit canonical envelopes (`schema_version="3.0.0"`) from day one.
- Consumers must reject legacy mission-domain envelopes on live paths.
- Historical `2.x` or pre-cutover data may only be read by offline migration or rewrite jobs.
- Offline rewrite workflows must convert historical data into canonical `schema_version="3.0.0"` form before re-ingestion.

## Cross-Repo Release Gates

`spec-kitty-events` should only be treated as released when all of the following are true:

1. `spec-kitty-events` package metadata matches the version declared at the top of this document.
2. Committed JSON Schemas are regenerated and drift-free.
3. Conformance fixtures and replay goldens pass with artifact-driven validation.
4. `spec-kitty-saas` is updated to emit canonical envelopes (`schema_version="3.0.0"`) only.
5. `spec-kitty` is updated to consume canonical mission/build terminology and fail-closed validation outcomes.

## Consumer Guidance

If you operate a producer:

- emit `schema_version="3.0.0"` (see the note above)
- emit `build_id`
- emit canonical mission-domain fields only

If you operate a consumer:

- validate the envelope signal before processing payload content
- reject forbidden legacy mission-domain fields and names
- treat pre-cutover data as migration input, not live traffic

## Quick Reference

Accepted live envelope:

```json
{
  "event_type": "WPStatusChanged",
  "aggregate_id": "mission/WP01",
  "schema_version": "3.0.0",
  "build_id": "build-2026-04-05",
  "node_id": "runner-01",
  "payload": {
    "mission_slug": "mission-001",
    "wp_id": "WP01",
    "from_lane": "planned",
    "to_lane": "claimed",
    "actor": "ci-bot",
    "execution_mode": "worktree"
  }
}
```

Rejected live envelope examples:

- envelope without `schema_version`
- envelope with `schema_version="2.9.0"`
- payload containing `feature_slug`
- envelope with `event_type="FeatureCreated"`
- envelope with `aggregate_id="feature/123"`

## Versioning

The on-wire envelope schema is `3.0.0`; the package version is declared at the
top of this document. Together they publish the canonical mission/build contract
and the recursive forbidden-key gate.

The full policy — what requires a major bump, what artifacts a bump must update,
and why the two version numbers are distinct — lives in
[`contracts/versioning-and-compatibility.md`](contracts/versioning-and-compatibility.md).

- `2.x` additive compatibility language no longer applies.
- Future breaking contract changes require a new major **package** release; whether they also bump the envelope schema version depends on whether they change the wire format. Neither the `5.0.0` nor the `6.0.0` package release bumped the wire-format envelope version — both changed contract behaviour with the existing `3.0.0` envelope shape.

### Post-mission lifecycle events (6.1.0)

The `6.1.0` release is **additive and wire-compatible**. It adds the
`MissionReopened` and `FollowUpRecorded` contracts, the
`MissionStatus.REOPENED` enum member (actionable, not terminal), and their
handling in `reduce_lifecycle_events`. The envelope shape is unchanged, but
consumers that validate or switch on exact event types must be upgraded before
they receive either new type. Producers must capability-gate emission until
each intended consumer recognizes it. Consumers that never receive the new
types are unaffected.

Producers emitting post-mission lifecycle facts need `>=6.1.0`.

### Genesis lane (6.0.0)

The `6.0.0` package release adds the `genesis` canonical lane (a non-display,
pre-finalize origin state; see `CHANGELOG.md`). Like `5.0.0`, this is a major
**package** bump that intentionally does **not** bump the wire-format envelope
version — it widens the set of accepted `Lane` values (`from_lane="genesis"` on
`WPStatusChanged`) while keeping the existing `3.0.0` envelope shape. Consumers
on `<6.0.0` will fail-closed (reject) a `from_lane="genesis"` payload; producers
must therefore gate genesis fan-out on the installed package's lane capability
until every consumer is on `>=6.0.0`.

Display consumers must not derive board columns, summary chips, progress rows,
or lane filters from every `Lane` member. Use `DISPLAY_LANES` for ordered
display/summary surfaces and `NON_DISPLAY_LANES` for explicit exclusions;
`Lane.GENESIS` is canonical for validation/replay but is not displayable.

## Local-CLI compatibility vs TeamSpace ingress validity (5.0.0)

The `5.0.0` major release sharpens a distinction that has always been implicit in
`spec-kitty-events`: there are two distinct validity domains, and a row that is
acceptable in one is not necessarily acceptable in the other. This section is the
authoritative explanation. Consumers and producers must read it before assuming
that "valid" is a single global property.

### The two validity domains

- **Local-CLI compatibility.** The `spec-kitty` CLI continues to read historical
  `status.events.jsonl` rows on local disk for users' own bookkeeping —
  reconstructing a mission's history, rendering local dashboards, replaying
  status, computing diff summaries, etc. The CLI's local reader is deliberately
  permissive: it tolerates pre-cutover envelope shapes (including legacy keys
  such as `feature_slug`, `mission_key`, raw rows missing `schema_version`, and
  pre-canonical lane vocabularies) so that users do not lose access to their own
  historical data after this bump. Local compatibility is **not** weakened by
  the `5.0.0` release.

- **TeamSpace ingress validity.** Only canonical envelopes pass TeamSpace
  ingress. The ingress path runs the full fail-closed contract gate from
  `4.0.0` plus the additions landed in this mission (canonical lane vocabulary
  including `in_review`, reconciled `MissionCreated`/`WPStatusChanged`/
  `MissionClosed` payloads, and the recursive forbidden-key validator that
  rejects legacy keys at any depth, including inside array elements). A row
  that the local CLI happily reads off disk will be rejected at TeamSpace
  ingress unless it has been canonicalized first.

### Concrete examples

A historical row that is **valid for the local CLI** but **invalid for
TeamSpace ingress** (legacy `feature_slug` key, missing `schema_version`):

```json
{"event_type":"FeatureCreated","aggregate_id":"feature/123","payload":{"feature_slug":"my-feature","feature_number":7}}
```

A canonical envelope that is **valid for both** the local CLI and TeamSpace
ingress (canonical mission-domain fields, canonical lane vocabulary including
`in_review`, `schema_version="3.0.0"`, no forbidden legacy keys at any depth):

```json
{"event_type":"WPStatusChanged","aggregate_id":"mission/WP01","schema_version":"3.0.0","build_id":"build-2026-05-01","node_id":"runner-01","payload":{"mission_slug":"mission-001","wp_id":"WP01","from_lane":"claimed","to_lane":"in_review","actor":"implementer-ivan","execution_mode":"worktree"}}
```

> **Package version vs envelope schema version (read this carefully).**
> The **package version** is the value in `pyproject.toml` and
> `__version__`, declared once at the top of this document. The
> **envelope schema version on the wire** is **`3.0.0`** — the default
> for `Event.schema_version` (and the value the strict profile requires).
> They are not the same number and they do not move together. The major
> package bump from `4.x` to `5.0.0` reflected contract behaviour changes
> (`in_review` canonical, payload reconciliation, recursive forbidden-key
> validator), NOT a wire-format envelope-version bump; `6.0.0`, `7.0.0`,
> and `8.0.0` likewise. Producers must continue to emit
> `schema_version="3.0.0"` on the envelope regardless of the package
> major; the strict profile rejects anything else.

### The documented bridge

The bridge between these two domains is the **CLI canonicalizer** that ships in
`spec-kitty` Tranche B. The canonicalizer reads historical `status.events.jsonl`
rows and produces canonical envelopes (`schema_version="3.0.0"`, accepted by
the strict profile) suitable for ingress. Producers that need to
forward historical data into TeamSpace MUST run it through the canonicalizer
first; ingress will not accept raw historical rows. Consumers that read locally
MUST NOT assume their local-disk rows have already been canonicalized.

### Bump rationale (per R-03)

The `5.0.0` package bump is a genuine major bump under semantic versioning.
The envelope schema version on the wire stays at `3.0.0`; only the *package*
moves to `5.0.0`. Per
research item R-03 (schema version bump semantic), each of the following is a
behavior change for at least one role and therefore each independently
justifies a major:

1. **Lane vocabulary widens.** `in_review` is now a canonical lane (FR-001,
   FR-002). Consumers that previously rejected `in_review` as unknown now
   accept it; consumers that switch on exact lane-set membership are
   behaviorally affected.
2. **Payload reconciliation.** `MissionCreatedPayload`,
   `WPStatusChangedPayload`, and `MissionClosedPayload` are now the single
   source of truth (FR-003, FR-004). CLI emission and library models have been
   reconciled; pre-bump producers of disagreeing shapes are now invalid.
3. **Recursive forbidden-key validator.** Legacy keys (`feature_slug`,
   `feature_number`, `mission_key`, plus the audit-derived expansion) are now
   rejected at any depth, including inside array elements (FR-005). Envelopes
   that previously slipped through with a deeply nested legacy key are now
   rejected.

These three changes compound: any one of them is a contract change for at
least one role, and together they require a major bump rather than a minor or
patch.

## Decision Moment V1 (4.0.0)

### Scope

- **Breaking for DecisionPoint.** The `DecisionPoint*` event family (excluding `DecisionPointOverridden`) now carries `origin_surface` and supports discriminated-union payloads. `DecisionPointResolved` (interview variant) requires `terminal_outcome`.
- **Compatible for DecisionInput.** `DecisionInputRequested` and `DecisionInputAnswered` payloads are unchanged. 3.x consumers continue to validate.

### Producer migration

| Producer                | 3.x action                         | 4.0.0 action                                                   |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| ADR DecisionPoint       | Emit 3.x payload                   | Add `origin_surface: "adr"` to every payload                    |
| Interview DecisionPoint | (n/a — didn't exist)               | Use `origin_surface: "planning_interview"` + V1 fields          |
| DecisionInput* events   | Emit as-is                         | No change                                                       |

### Consumer migration

| Consumer                              | 3.x action                                       | 4.0.0 action                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DecisionPoint replay / reducer        | Reduce 3.x ADR payloads                          | Reduce ADR + V1 interview events via the single reducer (discriminated by `origin_surface`) |
| DecisionInput* consumers              | Consume as-is                                    | No change                                                                    |
| Slack orchestrator                    | (n/a)                                            | Subscribe to `DecisionPointWidened`; post closure message on `DecisionPointResolved` |
| Teamspace projection                  | (n/a)                                            | Project V1 fields from `DecisionPointResolved` interview variant             |

### Terminal outcome / write-back rules

- `DecisionInputAnswered` is emitted ONLY when `DecisionPointResolved.terminal_outcome == "resolved"` AND `final_answer` is populated. Deferred and canceled outcomes do NOT emit a `DecisionInputAnswered` (no answer exists).
- `DecisionPointResolved.closed_locally_while_widened=true` is legal only when a prior `DecisionPointWidened` exists for the same `decision_point_id`. Reducers raise an anomaly (`kind="invalid_transition"`) and project the field as `false` if the precondition is not met.

### No grace period

4.x validators fail closed on missing `terminal_outcome` or missing `origin_surface`. There is no temporary permissive path. Downstream consumers must migrate deliberately against this contract boundary.
