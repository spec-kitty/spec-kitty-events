"""Status state model contracts for work-package lane transitions.

## Review-Rejection Transition Family

The **review-rejection transition family** is the named set of legitimate
forced backward lane transitions in WPStatusChanged events:

    | from_lane    | to_lane |
    |--------------|---------|
    | in_progress  | planned |
    | for_review   | planned |
    | in_review    | planned |
    | approved     | planned |

These transitions arise from user-deliberate rewinds in the work-package
lifecycle -- most commonly a review rejection that returns a WP to
``planned`` for re-implementation. They are not infrastructure events and
they are not graph errors.

### Wire requirements

For every event in the family, the emitting agent MUST set:

1. ``force = True`` -- explicit acknowledgement that the transition is a
   user-deliberate rewind, not a forward step.
2. ``reason`` -- a non-empty string. Enforced by the existing
   ``StatusTransitionPayload`` model validator
   (``force=True requires a non-empty reason``).

Recommended canonical ``reason`` shape::

    backward rewind: <from_lane> -> <to_lane>[: <feedback-ref>]

where ``<from_lane>`` / ``<to_lane>`` are the literal ``Lane`` enum values
and ``<feedback-ref>`` is optional. When present, the recommended URI shape
is ``feedback://<mission-slug>/<wp-id>/<timestamp>-<hash>.md``.

Optional but recommended for the four-pair review-rejection family:

* ``review_ref`` -- URI-shaped pointer to the review feedback artifact.
  Same value as ``<feedback-ref>`` above when both are populated.
* A separate ``ForceMetadata`` record carrying the structured
  ``(actor, reason)`` audit pair, attached at the carrying ``Event``
  envelope level. Consumers MAY rely on payload ``reason`` alone;
  ``ForceMetadata`` is for structured audit pipelines.

The wire payload shape is otherwise unchanged from
``StatusTransitionPayload``. No new fields, no removed fields.

### Unforced backward transitions are contract-invalid

A WPStatusChanged event with a ``from_lane -> to_lane`` pair drawn from the
family table but ``force = False`` is contract-invalid. The existing
``validate_transition()`` rejects such events via an explicit review-rejection family guard that runs before the lane matrix check; the violation message names ``force=True`` and the family name (``review-rejection``).

Consumers MAY route on the substring ``force=True`` or the substring ``review-rejection`` in the violation list to detect this family of failures without re-deriving family membership.

Consumers (materializers, projection engines, durable drain workers) MAY
reject these events as graph violations and SHOULD classify them as
business-rule rejections, not transient infrastructure failures. The CLI
emit path in spec-kitty MUST NOT produce unforced backward transitions:
either fail locally with a guidance message, or auto-promote
``force=True`` and synthesize a canonical ``reason`` per the recommended
shape.

### Relationship to ReviewRollback

``ReviewRollbackPayload`` (declared in
``src/spec_kitty_events/lifecycle.py``) is a mission-level event
recording the higher-level intent of a review rejection
(``mission_id``, ``review_ref``, ``target_phase``, ``affected_wp_ids``,
``actor``). It is NOT a substitute for the per-WP WPStatusChanged events
in the family -- the two are complementary records:

* ``ReviewRollback`` = "the mission rolled back to phase X because of
  review Y, affecting WPs [A, B, C]".
* ``WPStatusChanged(force=True, ...)`` per affected WP = "WP-A moved from
  ``in_review`` to ``planned`` as part of that rollback".

Consumers projecting state should reduce both event streams. Emitters MAY
emit only the per-WP WPStatusChanged events when no mission-level
rollback occurred (e.g. a single reviewer rejecting a single WP).

### Distinction from bootstrap-planned events

A forced ``* -> planned`` transition with ``from_lane = None`` is a
*bootstrap-planned event*, not a review-rejection. The contract
distinguishes them:

* Bootstrap-planned: ``from_lane is None``, ``to_lane = planned``,
  ``force = True``, ``reason`` typically explains initial seeding.
  Identified by ``is_bootstrap_planned_event()``.
* Review-rejection family member:
  ``from_lane in {in_progress, for_review, in_review, approved}``,
  ``to_lane = planned``, ``force = True``, ``reason`` follows the
  recommended backward-rewind shape.

A consumer must not classify a bootstrap-planned event as a review
rejection or vice versa.

### Forward-transition guards unaffected

Forward-transition guard semantics -- including but not limited to
``planned -> claimed``, ``in_progress -> for_review``,
``in_review -> approved`` -- are unchanged by this contract section.
``force = True`` is reserved for documented backward families and
terminal-lane exits. It MUST NOT be used to bypass forward guards or
evidence requirements.

### Conformance fixtures

The conformance fixture set under
``src/spec_kitty_events/conformance/fixtures/`` includes (registered in
``manifest.json``):

* id ``wp-review-rejection-cycle-replay`` --
  full lifecycle replay stream including one review-rejection round-trip
  (path: ``edge_cases/replay/wp_review_rejection_cycle.jsonl``).
* id ``wp-status-changed-approved-rewind-valid`` --
  positive single-event ``approved -> planned`` with
  ``force=True`` + reason
  (path: ``edge_cases/valid/wp_status_changed_approved_rewind.json``).
* id ``wp-status-changed-unforced-in-review-to-planned-invalid`` --
  negative single-event ``in_review -> planned`` with ``force=False``;
  validator MUST reject
  (path:
  ``edge_cases/invalid/wp_status_changed_unforced_in_review_to_planned.json``).

Sibling missions cite these by manifest id when authoring regression
tests.
