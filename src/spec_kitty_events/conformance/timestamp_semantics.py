"""Executable timestamp-semantics conformance helper.

The canonical event envelope's ``timestamp`` field is the producer-assigned
wall-clock occurrence time of the modelled event. Consumers (SaaS ingestion,
dashboards, audit, sync drains, projections, scorecards) MUST preserve this
value end-to-end and MUST NOT substitute server-receipt, import, drain, or
replay time for it.

This module provides a reusable conformance helper and a typed error so any
downstream repo can prove, with one regression test, that its ingestion path
preserves the producer occurrence time.

See:
- ``kitty-specs/teamspace-event-contract-foundation-01KQHDE4/data-model.md``
  (Timestamp Semantics: Rules R-T-01, R-T-02, R-T-03) for the authoritative
  rules.
- ``kitty-specs/executable-event-timestamp-semantics-01KRNME2/contracts/timestamp-semantics.md``
  for the executable contract.
