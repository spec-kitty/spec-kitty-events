"""Canonical project / mission / artifact / WP lifecycle event contracts.

This module defines the additional typed payload models needed by Spec Kitty
and TeamSpace to record the full canonical lifecycle:

* Project initialization (``ProjectInitialized``)
* Specify / plan / tasks artifact lifecycle (``SpecifyStarted`` /
  ``SpecifyCompleted`` / ``PlanStarted`` / ``PlanCompleted`` / ``TasksStarted`` /
  ``TasksCompleted``)
* Work-package creation (``WPCreated``)

The existing :mod:`spec_kitty_events.lifecycle` module already covers
mission-level lifecycle (``MissionCreated``, ``MissionStarted``, ...). This
module fills the gap below the mission level (project boot) and the gap
between *mission creation* and *first WP status* (per-artifact lifecycle and
WP creation).

Ordering, idempotency, and replay
---------------------------------

* Every event in this module carries either ``mission_slug`` (the canonical
  mission handle) or ``project_uuid`` (the canonical project handle). Consumers
  group and order events by those handles plus the standard envelope
  ``lamport_clock`` and ``event_id`` keys (see :mod:`spec_kitty_events.status`).
* Each contract is *idempotent on replay*: re-applying the same event by
  ``event_id`` is a no-op for consumers that keep an ``event_id`` ledger. The
  payloads are intentionally minimal and additive; they never carry derived
  state that conflicts with later events.
* Consumers are expected to materialize state as follows:

  1. ``ProjectInitialized`` opens the project aggregate. It MUST precede every
     other event in this module for the same ``project_uuid``.
  2. ``MissionCreated`` (from :mod:`spec_kitty_events.lifecycle`) opens the
     mission aggregate. SpecifyStarted/PlanStarted/TasksStarted events for
     that mission MUST follow ``MissionCreated``.
  3. For each artifact phase the canonical order is
     ``<Phase>Started`` then ``<Phase>Completed``. Re-running a phase emits a
     fresh ``<Phase>Started`` with a higher ``lamport_clock``; replay is
     order-preserving so the latest ``<Phase>Completed`` wins.
  4. ``WPCreated`` events MUST precede the first ``WPStatusChanged`` event for
     the same ``wp_id``. Consumers that see a ``WPStatusChanged`` for an
     unknown WP synthesize a *reconciliation diagnostic*, never silently
     create the WP from status alone.

* Bootstrap forced ``WPStatusChanged`` events with ``to_lane == planned`` and
  ``from_lane in {None, planned}`` are *initialize-only* by the status reducer
  (see :func:`spec_kitty_events.status.is_bootstrap_planned_event`). They never
  regress WP state on replay.

This is the consumer contract that TeamSpace import and the Spec Kitty local
dashboard both materialize from.
