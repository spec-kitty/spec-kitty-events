"""Zeitgeist attrs codecs for the volatile mission/WP event families (E2).

The Ephemeral Team Status design broadcasts mission/WP moments through each
team's Zeitgeist relay as *opaque bounded attributes*: one ``event`` frame is
``{kind, ref?, attrs}`` where ``attrs`` must be a flat ``str:str`` mapping
with at most 16 keys, at most 64 characters per key, and at most 240
UTF-8 bytes per value (which subsumes ≤240 characters, since a string's
UTF-8 byte length is never shorter than its character length), and no
forbidden key anywhere (zeitgeist issue:
``EventArgs {kind: ident, ref?: string≤240, attrs: {str:str}, ≤16 keys,
keys≤64 chars, values≤240 chars AND ≤240 B}``; design page
``ephemeral-team-status.html``, "The vocabulary" paragraph).

The relay's ``EventArgs`` schema bounds ``attrs`` keys at ≤64 *characters*
(``propertyNames.pattern`` **and** ``propertyNames.maxLength``: the
pattern is the ASCII-only ``[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._@+-]{0,63}``, and the
relay's validator checks it with a whole-string match — ``capabilities.py``
``_validate_node`` calls ``re.fullmatch``, not JSON Schema's usual
unanchored search — so it binds every character of the key, not just a
substring, and chars==bytes there. Independently of the pattern,
``propertyNames`` also carries no ``maxUtf8Bytes`` clause, unlike ``ref``
and ``additionalProperties`` below, so a character count is the only
key-length bound the relay applies either way) and
bounds values (and the frame's ``ref``) at ≤240 characters *and*
independently at ≤240 UTF-8 bytes (``maxLength: 240`` **and**
``maxUtf8Bytes: 240`` both present on ``attrs``'s ``additionalProperties``
and on ``ref``, in ``managed_control.schema.json`` and
``managed_live.schema.json`` since zeitgeist commit ``30d3ab4415``,
"Enforce event field byte limits", closing zeitgeist#20). The relay checks
both clauses independently (``capabilities.py``'s validator), so the
UTF-8-byte bound is the one that actually binds — a character count can
satisfy ≤240 chars while still exceeding 240 bytes, and the relay rejects
that. :func:`to_zeitgeist_attrs` enforces the 240-UTF-8-byte bound on
values and the 64-character bound on keys, both exactly matching the
relay's, since encode is where an over-length attr must be caught before
it ever reaches the wire. :func:`from_zeitgeist_attrs` checks the same
240-UTF-8-byte bound on values (not a character count — a value within
240 characters can still be relay-invalid at >240 bytes) and the
64-character bound on keys, so it does not accept an inbound frame the
relay itself would never forward (spec-kitty-events#16).

This module is the single owner of the mapping between this package's
volatile payload vocabulary and that wire shape:

* :func:`to_zeitgeist_attrs` — project one volatile payload *and its
  envelope* onto bounded attrs.
* :func:`from_zeitgeist_attrs` — validate inbound attrs against the same
  closed per-kind key vocabulary and return them as a
  :class:`VolatileMoment` (kind + ref + attrs), the typed view a consumer
  renders from.

Projection, not reconstruction
------------------------------
Attrs carry the *moment*: identity and transition facts. A relayed moment
deliberately does NOT rebuild the journal payload — two classes of field are
declared in :data:`UNBROADCAST_FIELDS` and stay local:

* fields whose shape cannot fit flat bounded strings —
  ``StatusTransitionPayload.evidence`` (structured evidence lists; this also
  keeps decode honest: ``to_lane ∈ {approved, done}`` payloads *require*
  evidence, so no decoder could rebuild them from attrs without fabricating
  audit data) and ``DecisionInputRequestedPayload.options`` (display hints
  of unbounded length);
* free-text prose — ``friendly_name`` / ``purpose_tldr`` /
  ``purpose_context``, a decision's ``question`` and ``answer``, and a
  forced transition's ``reason``. A moment is identifiers and transition
  facts; it renders from slugs, ids, lanes, and the actor label. Prose is
  stakeholder-facing text that would otherwise live on the team relay for
  the whole retention window.

Everything else the family declares rides in attrs; any carried value over
the bound raises rather than truncates: an oversize payload simply does not
broadcast (the CLI fan-out seam is fire-and-forget; a dropped moment is
lost *by design*, exactly like a downed relay or an expired budget). This
fail-closed rule is universal, with exactly one deliberate exception — see
"Bounded moment summaries" below.

Bounded moment summaries
-------------------------
:data:`SUMMARY_SOURCE_EVENT_TYPES` names the kinds whose moment needs a
short, human-readable gist alongside its identifiers: decision points
(question/answer plus a bounded slice of the rationale), mission creation
(friendly name plus purpose), and the three artifact-lifecycle ``*Completed``
kinds (their own producer-supplied ``summary`` field). For these kinds only,
:func:`to_zeitgeist_attrs` derives a single extra ``summary`` attr by joining
a fixed, per-kind, deterministic sequence of source fields with ``"; "``,
collapsing whitespace to one line. Unlike every other attr, ``summary`` is
allowed to carry short prose at all (projecting no human-readable gist would
defeat the point of these kinds' moment), and an oversize ``summary`` is
truncated — never raised — to the 240-UTF-8-byte bound with a trailing
``"…"`` marker, always splitting on a whole UTF-8 codepoint. When every
source field is empty, ``summary`` is omitted entirely rather than emitted
as an empty string. This is the one place this module's contract differs
from a raw payload field: everywhere else, prose stays local (see above) and
a value is never touched between "fits" and "raises".

Envelope identity rides too
---------------------------
The relay stamps receipt time and no id of its own onto what it forwards,
so :func:`to_zeitgeist_attrs` takes the event envelope as its second
parameter and carries ``event_id`` and ``occurred_at`` as explicit attrs.
Team Kitty deduplicates moments on ``(team, event_id)`` and renders their
declared occurrence time — neither is recoverable from receipt metadata.

Actor narrowing
---------------
Every family projects its ``actor`` to a single label string under the key
``actor``: :class:`~spec_kitty_events.status.StatusTransitionPayload` via
its ``actor_label`` property, and the mission-run family via
:class:`~spec_kitty_events.mission_next.RuntimeActorIdentity.actor_label` —
exactly the opaque ``actor_id``, never ``display_name`` or any other
free-text field. The mission-level payloads
(``MissionCreated`` / ``MissionClosed``) carry that label directly as their
optional plain-string ``actor`` field, so it rides under the same key with
no projection at all. A structured actor never rides field-for-field: the
relay has no actor member (it attests identity itself from the credential),
so broadcasting producer-asserted ids, providers, or model names would
re-introduce under dotted keys exactly what zeitgeist forbids flatly, while
duplicating the server-attested value.

Forbidden keys
--------------
:data:`FORBIDDEN_ATTR_KEYS` unions the legacy keys this package already
rejects (:data:`~spec_kitty_events.forbidden_keys.FORBIDDEN_LEGACY_KEYS`)
with a mirror of zeitgeist's direction-agnostic ingress set
(``capabilities.FORBIDDEN_KEYS_V1``, mirrored here by value with a version
suffix — zeitgeist owns transport policy, this package owns vocabulary, and
neither imports the other; same idiom as the harness-observation bounds
that mirror zeitgeist ``FIELD_MAX``). :func:`to_zeitgeist_attrs` refuses to
emit any of them, checking both the exact key and, for a one-level nested
key (``<field>.<sub>``), its trailing dot-segment — so a future nested
field named e.g. ``token`` cannot leak past the guard under a dotted key
just because the dotted string itself was never added to the forbidden set
(EXPERIMENTAL-spec-kitty-events#21). :func:`from_zeitgeist_attrs` applies
the identical check on the way in, for the same reason.

Mirrored from zeitgeist commit ``85be771f`` (``zeitgeist/capabilities.py``,
lines 135-140: ``FORBIDDEN_KEYS_VERSION = 1`` and the ``FORBIDDEN_KEYS_V1``
frozenset immediately below it), unchanged since. Nothing pins this value
automatically — zeitgeist's own ``registry_digest()`` hashes only
``registry.json`` and its managed schema files, not this constant — so
``tests/test_zeitgeist_forbidden_keys_drill.py`` reads the sibling
zeitgeist checkout's source (never imports the package: see above) and
asserts both set equality and :data:`ZEITGEIST_FORBIDDEN_KEYS_VERSION`
agreement. That drill skips when no sibling checkout is available; on
drift or a version bump, update :data:`ZEITGEIST_FORBIDDEN_KEYS_V1`,
:data:`ZEITGEIST_FORBIDDEN_KEYS_VERSION`, and this paragraph together
(spec-kitty-events#17).

            (26-char Crockford-base32 ULID, 36-char hyphenated UUID, 32-char
            bare hex UUID), or ``occurred_at`` does not parse as ISO-8601 or
            parses but is timezone-naive.
        ZeitgeistAttrsControlCharacterError: a value carries a non-printable
